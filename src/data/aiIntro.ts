export const aiIntroResponse = `Hi! I'm Fred Yang, an AI/ML Engineer and Photographer based in the intersection of technology and visual storytelling.

I spend my days building intelligent systems and training neural networks, but you'll often find me with a camera in hand, capturing the decisive moments that reveal the poetry hidden in everyday life. My work bridges the analytical precision of artificial intelligence with the intuitive artistry of photography.

My philosophy? "Code, Camera & Curiosity" - or as I like to say in Chinese: "世如未竟天工卷，格物致知珞玉心" (The world is like an unfinished scroll of divine craftsmanship; through investigation of things, we achieve knowledge and a heart like precious jade).

I'm passionate about exploring how AI can enhance creative processes while maintaining the human soul in art. Whether I'm optimizing algorithms or composing a shot, I'm always searching for that perfect balance between technical excellence and emotional resonance.

Feel free to explore my blog for insights on AI/ML developments, or check out my photography gallery where I document life's fleeting moments. Each image tells a story, and every line of code solves a puzzle.`;
