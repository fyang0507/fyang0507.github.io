In the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, I changed my understanding of the lean brother.

It turned out that Van Gogh was more ordinary than I had imagined. Compared to the universally acknowledged title of madman and the convulsive sunflowers in Hai Zi's eyes, what I encountered in the museum—that figure constantly migrating southward across the Western European continent—was not a shell captured and driven by inspiration, but a fragile yet robust craftsman who maintained the form and meaning of his life through the act of painting.

His eyes bore no mist different from ordinary people, nor was there anything hallucinatory or special about the world in his consciousness. Those heavy strokes of color from the Neo-Impressionist style were merely the channels he had carved through continuous exploration and seeking, in order to pour out the melancholy accumulated in his heart.

Yes, a pure genius should be a tool, a spirit or something similar that God has bound in human form to create beauty in the mortal world. They live solely to create, or to put it another way, to convey divine oracles—they should stand atop the mountain peak above all others from the day of their creation.


But Van Gogh was not like this.

The lean brother held his brush and painted tirelessly. In his complex work, he could gather scattered divine inspirations (like radium found in the waste of pitchblende ore!). Diligent work is a pathway; through this extremely inefficient method, people can climb to that peak shining with clear light.

I had the same feeling when studying classical music on MOOC; music had been stripped of its sacred meaning for me. Although Teacher Zhou Guoping said it was "the language of heaven," tracing the life trajectories of Beethoven and Bach, what I saw were not scenes of them frantically writing down gushing inspiration like lightning on paper, but rather, based on music theory foundations and continuous refinement of harmonic laws, they would meticulously fill entire works through repetition, variation, and other techniques around a theme...

It was then that I finally saw clearly that although music is a temporal, flowing art form, this doesn't prevent it from following certain spatial symmetries. And these rules and systems are exactly like the meter in poetry and the harmony in painting... beauty has always been following certain principles.


This is something full of inheritance. The frameworks established by previous masters to approach beauty are either consolidated or broken by their successors, thus achieving the evolution of human aesthetic cognition. This works the same way as science, or rather, humanity naturally lives within the causality of temporal sequences.

Humanity, before all supreme things, exists merely as craftsmen.

However, we must still affirm this craftsman spirit. Though we are ignorant and naked, we are not empty-handed.

Because those who know how to gaze and sharpen will eventually approach truth.

Let us continue talking about Van Gogh—let us start from his life story. Van Gogh was an "introverted and eccentric" person in his youth. Working at an art dealership, he became a pastor due to his fervent religious passion, though only for a period. Later, at his family's suggestion, he began developing in the direction of an artist. Although poor and often receiving financial support from his brother, and constantly moving between the Netherlands and Belgium, he steadily acquired basic knowledge of painting. He favored the countryside and peasants (peasant portraits were his first step to success). However, to encounter the avant-garde art of his contemporaries, he came to Paris and befriended other painters like Paul Gauguin. It was also during that period that he encountered the style of Japanese decorative prints (and became deeply fascinated, going on to copy and create), and his personal works shifted from dark to bright tones. Due to poor health, he went south to the countryside of southern France and created a large number of works; however, it was also in that warm yellow house that he broke with Gauguin. As his mental state became increasingly unstable, he voluntarily moved to a mental hospital, where he also entered the final phase of his career through extensive creation. Unable to bear the unbearable loneliness, he ultimately chose to shoot himself in the fields.

He was the kind of person who lived in his own world, in his own paintings, which is why he was so prolific.

As an ordinary person, in order to communicate better with himself and to better match his own expressiveness, he had to practice his techniques and observation like any ordinary person, innovating in his painting methods.

Looking at his numerous self-portraits, although the guide explained that Van Gogh did this because he was poor (couldn't afford to hire models) and to practice painting techniques (searching for his most expressive brushstrokes), I couldn't stop imagining this: when he sat in front of the mirror gazing at himself every day, or frequently, he was recording his face and mood like writing in a diary. Just like girls who frequently change their makeup for selfies (even the way of narcissism is the same), Van Gogh's view of himself was constantly changing: sometimes weary, sometimes confused, sometimes full of edges and alertness, sometimes appearing decadent.

Van Gogh constantly gazed at himself, capturing inner sensations. This seemed like a means of connecting the self with the outside world, as if through this form, Van Gogh's body could maintain normality and not expand excessively. As for what was trying to make him expand, I think it was probably something like a gas constantly produced by a personality that was incompatible with life.

The torrent of genius never surged forth—this is the limit of human understanding. However, if human understanding is a beam of light, then gazing and sharpening are the tools to focus this light.

When you keep gazing, gazing continuously, you will eventually become what you gaze upon. In this long river of human reproduction, many people may have already merged with the universe through this method.

But how ridiculous I was then—the south I urged myself to go to was merely geographically closer to the equator. Beyond that, it was nothing at all.

阿姆斯特丹的梵高博物馆里，我修正了自己对于瘦哥哥的认识。
原来梵高比我想象中更平凡。相较于举世公认的疯癫的称号，和海子眼中痉挛的向日葵；我在博物馆中见到的、那个在西欧大陆上不断向南迁徙的，并不是一个被灵感所俘虏所驱动的躯壳，而是凭借作画这个行为维持人生形态和意义的脆弱而粗犷的工匠。
他的眼眸并非染上了异于常人的雾翳，他意识中的世界也并无什么幻觉或特殊之处；而那些新印象派的一笔笔浓重色彩，不过是他为了倾泻心中的积郁，通过不断地摸索和探寻，最终凿通的水渠罢了。
是的，纯粹的天才应当是一种工具，一个神为了在人间创造美而用人形束缚的一团灵气或者类似的东西。他们活着仅仅是为了创造，或者换一种说法，为了传达神谕——他们应当自被创造之日起，就站在众人的山巅。

但梵高不是这样。
瘦哥哥、他拿着笔不知疲倦地作画，在繁复的工作中，他可以拾起零星的神灵的启示（犹如从沥青铀矿的废料之中找到的镭！）。勤劳的工作是一条通径，凭借这种效率极低的方式，人们才得以攀上那闪耀着澄澈之光的山巅。
我在MOOC上学习古典乐的时候，也有相同的感觉；音乐对于我已经剥离了其神圣性的意味。尽管周国平老师说那是“天国的语言”，但追寻贝多芬和巴赫的人生轨迹，我所看到景象的并不是他们如闪电一般在纸上疯狂写下喷薄的灵感，而是基于乐理基础和对音律和谐的不断推敲，将一种主题通过反复、变奏以及其他的技法，细致地将整个作品充盈起来……
那时的我终于看清，尽管音乐是时间性的流动的作品，但并不妨碍它们遵循某种空间意义上的对称性。而这种规章和制度，正是诗歌中的格律和绘画中的和谐色……美一直在遵循某些东西。

这是一件充满承袭意味的事情。前辈的大师们留下的为了接近美而设立的框架，后辈们或巩固或打破，而得以实现人类审美认知的进化。这和科学是一个道理，或者说，人类本来就这样必然地活在时间序列的因果之中。
人类，在所有至高之物面前，不过是工匠般的存在。
然而，我们仍然要肯定这样的工匠精神。我们虽然愚昧而赤裸，但我们并非两手空空。
因为懂得凝视和磨砺的人，终将接近真理。

我们继续来谈梵高、让我们从他的生平开始谈起。梵高年轻时候是个“内向而古怪”的人，在艺术品商行工作的他因为狂热的宗教热情而成为了牧师，然而也仅仅是一段时间。后来在家人的提议下他开始向艺术家的方向发展，虽然穷困而时常接受弟弟的接济，而同时也辗转于荷兰和比利时，但他稳步地习得了绘画的基本知识。他偏爱乡村和农民（农民的肖像则是他起家的第一步），然而为了接触同时代的先锋艺术，他来到了巴黎并结识了保罗·高更一类的其他画家。而也是在那个时期，他接触到了日本的装饰性版画的风格（并深深迷恋进而临摹创作），个人的作品色调也由暗转明。因为健康状况不佳，他又向南去了南法的乡村并创作了大量作品；然而也是在那个充满温情的黄房子里，他和高更决裂了。由于精神状态越来越不稳定，他又自愿搬到了精神病院中，同时也是在大量的创作之中进入自己生涯的尾声。因为无法忍受的孤寂，他最终选择在田野之中向自己开枪。
他就是那种活在自己的世界里，自己的画中，所以他才如此多产。

作为常人的他，为了和自己更好地交流，为了更加贴合自己的表现力，他必须像常人一样磨练自己的技法、观察，在绘画的方式上创新。
我看着他数量众多的自画像，虽然导览中介绍说梵高这么做是因为穷（没钱聘请模特）和锻炼绘画技法（寻找自己最有表现力的笔触），但我无论如何也不能停止这样的想象，那就是：当他每天，或者频繁地、坐在镜子前凝视自己的时候，他就像是在记日记一样记录自己的面孔和心情。那和频繁变换妆容的女生的自拍一样（连自恋的方式都一样），梵高眼中的自己也在时刻变化着：有时倦怠，有时迷茫，有时充满棱角和机敏，有时却显得颓废。

梵高一直凝视自己，捕捉内感觉。这仿佛是一种将自我和外界连接的手段，仿佛借助这种形式，梵高的身体才可以保持常态，不至于过度膨胀一样。至于是什么东西要让他膨胀起来，我想那大概是与生活格格不入的性格在一直产生某种气体的类似物吧。
天才的洪流从未涌现，这是人类理解力的界限。然而，如果人类的理解力是一束光线的话，凝视和磨砺就是收束这光芒的工具。
当你一直、一直凝视，你就终将变做自己的凝视之物。在这漫漫繁衍的人类的长河中，许多人可能已经借此与宇宙融为一体了。

可是那时的我是多么可笑啊，我催促自己前往的南方，居然仅仅在地理意义上更接近赤道而已。除此之外居然什么也不是。
