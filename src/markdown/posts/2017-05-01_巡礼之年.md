# Years of Pilgrimage - Switzerland

The gentle piano melody grows stronger, shifting to Liszt's *Années de pèlerinage*.
First Year: Switzerland.

Gazing down from the airplane window, the town beneath the winter snow lies quiet and soft, like white clouds slowly gathering by the lakeside, almost carrying a hint of wine's fragrance born from long fermentation—and this is Geneva. As an international metropolis, it embraces world-renowned organizations including the Red Cross, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Office at Geneva, and CERN.

Yet I would say it feels more like a small town. Rather than its prestigious title as the world's capital of horology, the Flower Clock is merely a small urban corner that locals might pass by during their strolls. What I prefer more is this: on a spring afternoon caressed by gentle breezes, munching on a sandwich while watching birds leave swift silhouettes across the sky—almost like the fleeting contrails against the azure heavens. Those leisurely fluttering flags remind you that these emblems represent the world's most advanced banking industry; but you don't particularly care. Hey, you suddenly wonder, might Rousseau have once sat on a bench like this, gazing toward the French mountains across the lake, contemplating his world-shocking *Social Contract*?

Following the crescent-shaped lake northward, half an hour brings you to Lausanne. I lingered long in the central train station. Everywhere, hurried human figures intersect, and amid this chaos I tried to find a shadow from the last century—Marguerite Lecœur—who had escaped from Patrick's *Horizon* and once rested here briefly. But it's impossible; she belongs to another dimension of time, one more suited for disappearance than forgetfulness.
So let us climb those not-too-steep slopes planted with vineyards—I think you'll love these wines wrapped tight with sunshine! Lake Léman shimmers below with varying shades of blue-green; and if you continue to gaze into the distance, perhaps you can see another small, winding town at the foot of the mountains on the opposite shore.
Hey, that's Évian! Yes, indeed the very Évian of Évian mineral water!

Let us sail eastward! At the eastern end lies Chillon Castle. You walk beneath those towering battlements that have endured wind and snow (a full ten centuries of storms!) yet remain steadfast, but still cannot conjure any romantic reverie. Because supposedly, residents of ancient Europe without drainage systems would, every morning from their second floors, dump their overnight filth down into the streets—right where you're standing now!
Descending into the dungeon, the world seems stripped away, leaving only the sound of water. Peering through the iron bars, the dazzling lake surface reflects like candles, illuminating the graceful silhouettes of distant mountains while perhaps also burning away the prisoners' last drops of hope.
But then again, who says foreigners don't scribble on ancient monuments? Those pillars are also covered layer upon layer with Latin letters; only that even in such crowding, Byron's signature, formally framed, remains particularly conspicuous.

Following the railway northward, let us witness the equally absurd natural landscape of this nation of stunning wealth, as the train announcements shift from French to German. Station names counted along the way: Thun, Interlaken, Lucerne... They will shamelessly drain your camera's battery and memory; after all, honestly, when you leave the bustling metropolitan area and are suddenly exposed to such mountain and water scenery, what else can you do but express your awe through stunned silence? As for me, I can't believe I would actually shed tears just from gazing at the reflection of snow-capped mountains... Young Werther spoke truly—this magnificent divine power has absolute strength to penetrate the heart, making this joy sacred and pure.
The train stops: Zurich. This "super" city that contributes over twenty percent of Switzerland's GDP perhaps also contains over twenty percent of the entire nation's liveliness, which for a country that is essentially a vast pasture provides just the right comfort—not too quiet. Sitting in a café on an ancient street, occasionally young people who look like university students pass by in groups, reminding you that ETH Zurich was Einstein's alma mater. On the evening streets, the gradually fading and lengthening sunset ignites the streetlights. Restaurants light their candles as dinner begins: trams carry the rich aroma of cheese fondue through the city. And I climb the twin towers of the cathedral, leaning over the not-so-spacious platform to watch the entire city gradually fall asleep as expected. In this slowly condensing twilight, Orion is washed ashore onto the night sky by the tide.

The terminus heading north, the city of a thousand steps almost at the border: St. Gallen. Starting from the outside, you tirelessly break through arc after arc of residential barriers, finally, after passing through yet another narrow alley, suddenly finding yourself on an incongruously open lawn. —You had already tried to understand the Benedictine monastery and its priceless collection of ancient books through guidebooks, yet you still hadn't anticipated that this abbey, built as early as the eighth century, would be such a colossal edifice looking down upon all living beings. You put on felt slippers, respectful like an uninvited guest who has presumptively entered another's study; every Baroque ornamental detail adds to the already heavy and elegant atmosphere of the interior, until you inadvertently glimpse at some corner an aged aerial photograph: houses embracing the church, like roots clustering around a flower.
People live to make pilgrimages! you think with irrepressible excitement. But you ultimately revise this hasty statement. Perhaps this expression would be more fitting:
To live is to build a Tower of Babel for oneself.

绵柔的琴声渐强，曲集移往李斯特、巡礼之年。
第一年： 瑞士 。
从舷窗俯望下去，冬雪下覆盖的市镇沉静而柔软，好似湖畔旁慢慢积聚的白云，几乎有了一丝因长时间酝酿而散出的酒香——而这就是日内瓦 。作为一个国际都市，它怀抱着包括红十字会、世界卫生组织、联合国欧洲总部、 欧洲核子研究中心等名越四海的世界级组织。
然而我说，它也许更像是个小镇。比起世界钟表之都这样的煊赫称谓，花钟不过是当地人散步时可以顺带经过的城市一隅的小景。而我更偏爱的是，在春风拂煦的中午时分，啃着三明治，看飞鸟在天空留下一抹抹敏捷的身影——几乎像极了湛蓝天空上转瞬即逝的航迹云。那些悠然飘荡的旗帜提醒你，这些纹徽可代表着世界上最为发达的银行业呢；可是你并不十分理会。诶、你突然想到，当年卢梭会不会也如你这般坐在长椅上，望向对岸的法国群山，构思着他那惊骇世俗的《社会契约论》呢？
沿着月牙型的湖泊北上，半个时辰便是洛桑 。我在中央火车站中流连许久。到处是匆忙的人形交错，而我在这混杂中试图寻找一个上世纪的背影——玛格丽特·勒科兹——她自帕特里克的《地平线》中逃逸而出，曾经在这里稍作休憩。然而不行的，她属于另一中维度时间，而那个时间比起遗忘更适合消失。

所以让我们爬上那些匹并不陡峭的种满葡萄的山坡吧——我想你会喜欢这些紧裹着阳光的佳酿！粼粼波光下的莱蒙湖正泛出深浅不一的青色；而如果你继续极目远眺的话，也许你可以看到对岸山脚下另一个蜿蜷的小小的镇子。
嘿、那里就是依云哦！没错、千真万确是依云矿泉水的那个依云哦。

让我们乘船向东！东岸的尽头便是西庸城堡。你从那些久经风雪（整整十个世纪的风霜雨雪！）而依然弥坚的高耸的城垛下走过，却依然做不出任何浪漫的怀想。因为据说，没有排水系统的古老欧洲的居民，总是在清晨从二楼把那些隔夜的秽物向街道一倾而下——就是你现在站的这个地方！
而潜入地牢，世界仿佛被剥离只留下水声。从铁栅栏望出，因反光而炫目的湖面如同蜡烛，在点燃隔岸山脉绰约风致的同时，只不定也烧尽了囚徒们最后一滴希望。
可是话说回来、谁说老外就不会在古迹上乱涂乱刻呢？那些柱子也被层层叠叠的拉丁字母覆盖着；只不过，即使在这样的拥挤之中，被一本正经装裱起来的拜伦的签名仍然是尤为显眼就是了。

沿着铁道北上，让我们在火车广播由法语转向德语的途中，一览这个拥有惊人财富国度的同样近乎荒谬的自然景观。沿途数过的站名： 图恩 、 因特拉肯 、 卢塞恩 …它们会毫不愧怍地榨干你相机的电量和内存；毕竟说真的，当你离开繁华的都市圈就突然被暴露在这样的山光水色中时，你除了以目瞪口呆的方式表达自己的敬畏之外，还能做什么呢？反正我啊，我都不相信自己居然会仅仅因为凝望雪山的倒影就可以啪嗒啪嗒地滴泪……少年维特说得不假，这壮丽的神威有沁透人心的绝对力量，因而这欢乐是神圣而纯粹的。
列车停靠， 苏黎世 。这个为整个瑞士贡献超两成GDP的“超级”城市或许也装下了整个国家超两成的热闹，而这对于几乎就是庞大牧场的国度来说是一种不至太过安静的刚刚好的舒适。在古街的咖啡馆中坐下，偶有大学生模样的年轻人结伴经过，你这才想起联邦理工正是爱因斯坦的母校。傍晚时分的街道上，渐隐渐长的夕阳擦燃街灯。餐厅点燃烛光，晚宴开始了：有轨电车带着奶酪火锅的馥郁穿城而过。而我登上大教堂的双子塔楼，在并不宽敞的平台外，俯身看向整个城市如预想中渐渐睡去。就在这逐渐凝练的薄暮中，猎户被夜潮冲上天幕。

一路向北的终点，几乎可以算是边境的千阶之城， 圣加仑 。你从外侧开始，不厌其烦地突破一道道民居铸成的弧形封锁，才终于在又一次穿过促狭的胡同后，突然置身于一片不合时宜的开阔的草坪。——你早就在攻略中尝试了解本笃会修道院和它那无价的古籍藏书，然而你仍然没有料想到，这个早在八世纪就兴建起来的经院、居然会是这样一个睥睨众生的庞然大物。你穿上羊粘质地的拖鞋，恭敬得像不请自来的擅自踏入他人书斋的客人；每一个巴洛克式的堂皇装饰都要徒增这室内本就沉重而古雅的空气，你终于不经意在某个转角瞥见这样一张老旧的航拍照片：民宅环抱教堂，犹如根须簇拥花朵。
人活着就是为了朝圣！你抑制不住激动地想。然而你最终还是修改了这种仓促的说法。 还是说这样表达会更贴切一些呢：

活着，就是为自己造一座巴别塔。
