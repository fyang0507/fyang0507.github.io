Turning the corner from the Pompidou Center, I suddenly caught sight of a magnificent and ancient city hall. Tourists bustled through the grand square in front of the building; someone was blowing soap bubbles, delighting children who leaped and chased after them. The weather was gradually clearing, clouds drifting by in succession, and the French tricolor atop the building fluttered vigorously in the wind. The sunshine of mid-May was so bright it felt almost scorching, while beyond lay the Seine, the Île de la Cité, and Notre-Dame...
This is Paris. Though I wouldn't say it haunts my dreams, I do harbor special expectations for this city through countless novels I've read. Those districts and place names stretching before my eyes always give birth to story after story—different eras, different social classes. The history of this city is so profound, yet it doesn't feel particularly oppressive; in my imagination, it's like a girl living in another dimension who, despite witnessing countless vicissitudes of change, remains too languid to alter her appearance for any of it.
I fantasize about stepping out from winding paths onto the suddenly expansive Champs-Élysées, gazing up at the sky, watching sunlight strike the plane tree leaves, listening to the tremendous pulsing of this city's life; at the star-shaped plaza's center, beneath the Arc de Triomphe, savoring the interplay between Chinese characters and radiating districts; walking along the avenue toward Montmartre, paying homage to the heights where artists once gathered, where Van Gogh once stayed; observing the Eiffel Tower from afar, critiquing like an old gentleman this metal tower so incompatible with classical architecture; approaching the lights of the Latin Quarter as they kindle at dusk, drawing near to Odette's secret life and the veil that pierced Swann's heart; wandering the streets of Montmartre late at night, following the rebellious youth of Lulu's childhood escape; and the bells of Notre-Dame, the boats on the Seine... Ah! Paris, let those magical characters and stories take the stage in turn—allow me to prostrate myself at the hem of your skirt!
But in reality, I can only shoulder my backpack like any ordinary tourist, shuttling and disappearing into this city's cacophonous background alongside countless other ordinary tourists. I've tried innumerable times to approach that feeling—but what do I actually see? Garbage blown by strong winds in front of the Moulin Rouge, the dirty flowing water of the Seine, crowds of visitors queuing at Shakespeare and Company... The sky, low-hanging dark clouds severing souls that should roam free! The city I imagined was full of dreams, but the scenery before my eyes is so jarringly, unmistakably real.
Not long ago, I was still puzzled by such disparities—the tremendous changes in travel patterns over the past century. I've read countless accounts of Russian nobles traveling from Siberian wilderness to Western Europe for the social season, of aristocratic ladies moving from inland castles to Mediterranean shores for winter, or of travelers journeying from America to the European continent—their migratory lifestyle makes it impossible to say where their true residence lies. They were there, staying in suburbs to escape summer heat, residing in spa sanatoriums for recuperation; even if someone told you they would live there for a whole year, ten years, a lifetime, you would hardly feel any surprise.
But ever since passports came into being, we seem to have been instantly forced into certain identities, compelled to settle in specific places while being denied the right to lodge long-term elsewhere (though this isn't entirely the passport's fault). We tour five countries in seven days, see an entire continent in twenty-five days, then return to trajectories identical to those we left behind. Has our way of life changed at all? No, no—in every city, we're like rude guests who barge straight into others' homes and loudly order from menus. Why would someone resting in a café due to travel fatigue brazenly claim to have experienced authentic Parisian ambiance? All travel blogs are merely hodgepodges of guides and to-do lists; what determines their quality isn't the narrator's lifestyle interests and philosophy, but travel efficiency. Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Those comments cry out loudly, as if scenic spots and experiences were comparable things; the highest praise I can think of is that you've captured postcard-perfect photos... People who can see beyond tourist attractions during brief, high-intensity trips are few and far between.
If possible, I truly wish to take a journey without any itinerary. Not rushing from one attraction to the next using the shortest time and most economical methods, but employing random encounters to discover some inevitability about this city—the kind of inevitability that makes Notre-Dame necessarily stand in Paris. Without this, Notre-Dame appearing as a tourist attraction in Rome would allow us to pose shamelessly for photos there too (unfortunately, most travel nowadays is precisely this nutritionally void).
This is a double barrier, a double blow! As a fantasist, I can only see momentary realities that stand apart from the everyday; as a hurried tourist, I cannot see those precious things this city has accumulated through hundreds of years of silent growth.

Yes! These things we simply cannot change!

Farewell, women with iris flowers tucked jauntily in your hat brims! Farewell, dignified musketeers riding past on the Palais-Royal avenue!
But if we're shameless enough, we can still say this:
"What matters in travel isn't the destination, but who accompanies you."
Saying this suddenly reminds me that people from Chengdu, even on suburban outings, merely change locations to play mahjong. Whether in rapeseed flower fields, by streams, or at hot springs, what matters isn't the scenery but the mahjong partners and luck... Humans! You're quite inventive when it comes to socializing.
Honestly, I may lose the motivation to continue traveling—especially to those great metropolises that have truly stood for over a thousand years and will inevitably continue standing for thousands more. Due to objective modernization and subjective modern tourism—as Han Shaogong said, all cities in the world are increasingly becoming one city... I cannot possibly seek out that elegance of carriages, horses, saddles, and hairpins. That graceful bearing exists only in Proust's childhood—and the similar hazy emotions I dimly sense through his words may well not represent Proust's original intentions either.
Come to think of it, perhaps only these hazy emotions can be considered each city's unique heritage.

从杜皮蓬的艺术馆转过街角，突然就看见一大幢雄伟而古老的市政厅。游客熙熙攘攘从建筑前面的大广场走过；有人吹起肥皂泡，引起儿童雀跃和追逐。天气逐渐转晴，云朵渐次飘过，房子顶层直插的法兰西国旗猎猎翻飞。五月中旬的阳光明媚得甚至有点炎热，而再远处是塞纳河、 湖心岛和圣母院……

这里是巴黎。虽然说不上魂牵梦萦，但我在无数小说之中，的确对这个城市有着特殊的期待。那些在我眼前延展开的地区和地名总是催生着一个一个的故事——不同的时代、不同的阶级。这个城市的历史如此厚重，然而却并没有显得非常压抑；在我想象中，那仿佛是活在另一个维度里面的少女，虽然见证了无数沧海桑田的变化，却依然慵懒得不肯为之改变一下容貌。

我幻想着自己踏出曲径，在豁然开朗的香榭丽舍大道上仰望天空，看阳光打在梧桐叶上、聆听这城市巨大的生命的悸动；在星形广场正中央、凯旋门，体味汉字和放射性街区交互的况味；沿着大道走向蒙马特，拜谒梵高呆过的艺术家集聚的高地；从远处观望埃菲尔，像老绅士一样批评这个与老派建筑格格不入的金属塔楼；接近黄昏时分点燃的拉丁区灯光，接近奥黛特的秘密生活和令斯万先生痛彻心扉的面纱；在夜深的红磨坊街区浪游，跟踪露姬小时候叛逃的青春；还有圣母院的钟声、塞纳河的游船……啊！巴黎，那些神奇的人物和故事依次登场，请让我拜服在你的裙裾之下！

可事实上呢，我只能像一个普通的游客一样背着背包，和另外许多普通的游客一起穿梭和消失在这个城市嘈杂的背景之中。我尝试了无数次，想要接近那种心情——可我看到的又是什么啊？红磨坊的门前的垃圾被大风吹起，塞纳河脏污的流水，莎士比亚书店前成群排队的参观者……天空、低垂的乌云截断了本该自由驰骋的灵魂！我想象中的这座城市充满梦幻，但眼前的风景却是确凿得那么刺眼的真实。

我不久前还对这样的差异疑惑不解，这百年之间旅游方式的巨大改变。我见过无数次，从西伯利亚荒原到西欧展开社交季的俄国贵族，从内陆的城堡到地中海沿岸越冬的贵妇人，或者从美国到欧洲大陆的旅行家——他们候鸟般的生活方式使你根本不能说哪里才是他们真正的定居点。他们在那里，为了消夏而呆在郊区，为了调养而住进温泉疗养院，即使有人告诉你他们将在那里住上一整年、十年、一辈子，你也几乎不会感到有任何惊奇。

可是自从有了护照之后、我们仿佛瞬间被强制成为了某种身份，强制在某个地方安家，而否定其他地方可以长期留宿的权利（当然这也不全是护照的错）。我们用七天游玩五个国家，用二十五天看完一个大洲，然后又回到和出发前一模一样的轨迹当中。我们的生活方式发生了任何改变吗？不、不、在每一个城市，我们都像径直走进他人宅院然后大声点菜的不礼貌的客人。因为旅途劳顿而在一家咖啡馆休憩的人，为什么竟会大言不惭地说自己体会到了正宗的巴黎风貌呢？所有旅行网站上的游记，不过都是攻略和待办事项列表的杂合而已；而品评游记高低的，并不是记述人的生活情趣和理念，而是旅行的效率。美！美！美！那些评论大声呼号，仿佛景点和阅历是可以相提并论的东西一样；而我觉得最高的赞美，不过是你照出了明信片一般的照片……能从短期的高强度旅行中看到除景点以外东西的人，少之又少。

如果可能，我真想做一次毫无攻略的旅行。不是从一个景点用最短的时间最经济的方式奔波到下一个景点，而是采用随机性的邂逅，发现这个城市的某种必然性——那种巴黎圣母院必须伫立在巴黎的必然性。若非如此，那么圣母院作为一个景点出现在罗马，我们也可以放肆地留影了（然而很不幸，现今大多数旅行都是这样地没有营养）。

这是双重的隔膜，双重的打击！作为一个幻想家只能看到析居于日常之上的瞬间真实；作为一个匆匆的游客却看不到这个城市通过几百年的静默生长而沉淀的那些宝贵之物。

是的！这些东西我们竟然无法改变！

再见了！帽檐上斜插着鸢尾小花的女人们！再见了！从王宫大道上骑马而过的器宇轩昂的火枪手！

可是如果我们脸皮足够厚的话，我们还可以这么说。

“所谓旅行，重要的并不是目的地，而是和谁一起同行。”

这么一说我突然想起成都人的郊游也不过是换个地方打麻将。油菜花田里也好，小溪里也好温泉里也好，重要的是不是风景，而是麻友和手气……人类！你们为了社交也是别出心裁。

说真的，我或将失去继续旅行下去的动力——尤其是，去那些实实在在地伫立了上千年，又必然会继续伫立千年的大都会。由于客观的现代化和主观的现代旅行主义——如韩少功所说，世界上所有的城市，越来越成为一个城市……我是不可能寻着那份车马鞍簪的优雅了。那份绰约的风致，仅仅在普鲁斯特童年里存在着——而我透过文字隐隐约约感觉到的那种类似的朦胧情感，也很可能也并不普鲁斯特的原意。

说起来，也许只有这份朦胧的情感，才算得上每个城市独特的遗产。
