When I traveled alone in southern France, the sun that rose in the east and set in the west always lingered long in the sky. Before six o'clock it was already bright, and at nine the sky remained clear; especially in the afternoons, the sunlight would beat down without any cover, making the entire city feel as if it were being strangled at the throat, leaving one thoroughly uncomfortable.
On the seaside promenades of every city, besides the tall palm trees, there were many movable dark blue iron chairs. At first glance, they seemed to be a thoughtful government welfare project designed for lustful tourists to concentrate on admiring the bikini beauties on the beach. But surprisingly, many locals also enjoyed sitting on them to rest; young people listened to music, while the elderly would read newspapers and work on the sudoku puzzles and word games in them.
Obviously, designing the chairs to be movable was a well-considered decision. As the sun's position changed throughout the day, people could move their chairs to keep themselves perpetually in the shade of the trees.
Southern France under the sun is beautiful, yet for tourists who must stroll along the seaside promenades, the sun's direct rays are not only a physical force capable of tanning the skin, but also a spiritual assault sufficient to ruin one's leisurely mood. I believe it is precisely this feeling that makes Singapore remarkably lacking in open-air sidewalks; and it is precisely the absence of this experience (tourists can spend almost their entire time in air-conditioned tour buses) that has earned Singapore its reputation as a garden city.
When I sat in the insufficiently air-conditioned bus heading toward Cannes, I would consciously or unconsciously mistake the cities we passed through for Oran—that city in Camus's work where the plague broke out. I certainly don't know the sequence of this reflexive thinking, but in any case, Oran and Nice, Cannes, though located on opposite shores, are all cities along the Mediterranean.
In Camus's eyes, Oran was a city "without imagination"; and under the influence of climate, it was filled with an air that was "both fervent and absent-minded."
I now strongly emphasize the compatibility between a person's nature and their environment. For instance, people in the tropics must develop the habit of afternoon naps, because during the hottest hours of the day, if people expect to concentrate and accomplish anything, it is almost futile. Only when you actually walk beneath the palms and blazing sun do you realize that only a carefree state of mind can allow one to live contentedly. Otherwise, if one still needs to persist in something or is eager to express some sentiment, you will be stirred to extraordinary irritation by these sweaty heat waves.
That irritation is almost a biological instinct—not the driving force of pressing forward in search of shade with determined effort, but rather an irrational attitude of irresponsibly continuing to expose oneself to an uncomfortable environment. You could almost say that people in such a state approach decadence. How to put it? In such moments, people possess this mentality—it wouldn't matter if the rest of life were spent this way. I think people from the tropics would hardly fear the eternal fires of Christian hell, because such burning does not make one focus on the heart-rending physical pain of one's own flesh, but rather drives one toward the dissipation of emptying the mind, a state of indifference to any situation.
The opposite is freezing cold. Conversely, cold compels people to concentrate. Even physically speaking, in cold conditions the pores contract and the entire body operates in a mode of storing heat—which corresponds spiritually to a state of inward compression.
Returning to the question: what kind of experience did the residents of Oran have during the plague? This setting by Camus, whether intentional or not, aptly deepened people's understanding of the mundane. The plague is terrible, yet people living long under the shadow of the epidemic will ultimately lose their initial experience of fear and anxiety, and can face this new normal as if nothing had happened. Camus said this "unambiguous reality" makes disaster less spectacular than anything else, and moreover, "the very duration of great misfortunes is monotonous." And I believe that under the climatic conditions of the Mediterranean's hot, dry summers, this dulling of perception would be quite markedly amplified; the dissipative mentality of "not wanting to care" would greatly accelerate the residents' adaptation process.
Finally, there seems to be no particular advice worth proposing as a conclusion. I have merely recorded an observable phenomenon and personal inner experience. However, from this example of mind-body interaction, we can also understand the wisdom contained in the saying "a calm mind naturally brings coolness"; and in this sense, are idealism and materialism still two extremes of ideological thinking?

我在南法独自旅行的时候，东升西落的太阳总是长久地滞留在天空之上。六点不到已经大亮，九点的天色依然晴朗；而尤其是午后的时候，阳光总是毫无遮掩地打下来，整个城市就像被扼住了咽口一般让人浑身难受。

每个城市的海滨大道上除了一株株高大的棕榈，还有许多可以活动的深蓝色铁制椅子。乍一看似乎是为好色的游客可以专心观赏海滩的比基尼美女而被细心安置的政府福利工程，可是令人意外的是，似乎很多当地人也喜欢坐在上面休憩；年轻人听音乐，老年人则会看报纸，顺带着做做报纸上的九宫格和words puzzle.

显然设计成可以移动的椅子是经过认真考量的。随着一天之中太阳位置的变化，人们就可以移动椅子让自己始终处于树荫之下。

阳光下的南法是美丽的，然而对于一定要漫步滨海大道的游客来说，太阳的直射不仅是一种可以晒黑肤色的物理力量，也是一种足以毁掉轻松心情的精神攻击。我相信正式这种感觉，才让新加坡异常地缺乏露天的人行道；也正是缺少了这种体验（游客几乎可以在开着冷气的旅行车里度过），新加坡才有了花园城市的美誉。

当我坐在空调开得非常不足的公交车中向着戛纳行进的时候，我总是有意无意地把途经的城市认做阿赫兰、那座加缪笔下疫病爆发的城市。我当然不知道这种思考反射的先后顺序，总之阿赫兰与尼斯、戛纳，尽管位于南北两岸，却都是地中海沿边的城市。

在加缪的眼中，阿赫兰是一座“毫无臆想”的城市；而在气候的作用下，充满了一种“既狂热，又心不在焉”的神气。

我现在非常强调一个人的天性与其身处环境之间的相性，比如热带的人民是一定要养成午睡的习惯的，因为在一天里最炎热的时刻，人们如果期望能集中精力做些什么事情，那几乎是徒劳的。当你切切实实走在棕榈和烈阳之下，你才知道只有那种蛮不在乎的心境才能让人过得怡然自得。否则，如果人还需要坚持什么东西，热衷于表达什么言语的话，你就会被这种汗涔涔的热浪搅得异常地烦躁。

那种烦躁几乎是一种生物性的本能，那并不是一种急于寻找荫蔽的一鼓作气往前走下去的推动力，而是一种毫无责任心地将自己持续暴露在使人不舒服的环境下的非理性态度。你几乎可以说人在那种状态下是接近堕落的。怎么说呢，在那种时刻人是拥有这样的心态的——余下的人生就这么度过也毫无所谓。我想热带的人民是不会怎么惧怕基督教中地狱的永恒烈火的炙烤的，因为所谓炙烤并不是会让人专注于关注自身肉体撕心裂肺的痛苦，而是驱使人将头脑放空的耗散，对任何情况不以为意的无所事事。

与之相反的是冰冻。从相反的意义上说，寒冷是迫使人集中精力的。即使从肉体上来讲，寒冷状态下的毛孔收缩，全身以贮存热量的形式活动着——这在相对应的精神上就表现为一种向内压缩的状态。

回过头来说，阿赫兰的居民在鼠疫中是一种怎样的体验呢？加缪的这种设定，无论说是否有意，恰巧加深了人们对于日常性的理解。鼠疫是可怕的，然而长期生活下疫情笼罩下的人们将最终失去担惊受怕的最初体验，而尽可以若无其事地面对这种新常态。加缪说，这种“现实的明白无误性”使得灾祸比任何东西都不壮观，而且，“巨大的祸患时间之长本身就十分单调。”而我相信，身处地中海夏季高温少雨的气候条件下，这种感知的钝感将会被相当明显地放大；“不想管”的耗散心态将大大加速居民的适应过程。

最后，作为结论似乎也并没有什么值得提出的建议。我仅仅是记述了一种可供观察到的现象和个人的内心体验。然而，从这种身心相互作用的例子中，我们也能了解“心静自然凉”所蕴含的理趣了；而从这个意义上说，唯心和唯物难道还是思想形态的两种极端么？
