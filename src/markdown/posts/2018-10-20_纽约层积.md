From the moment our car crossed the Triborough Bridge into Manhattan, I was struck by an uncanny sense of being in Milan—and this wasn't because we were entering Little Italy. The factors contributing to this illusion: the World Trade Center's Eataly gleaming with magnificent glass décor; or the subway system—those bidirectional tunnels revealed in their purely functional form, train cars built solely for capacity, the rebellion of graffiti and stains against lifeless brick walls—all demonstrated a shocking synchronicity between these two cities. Particularly when I strolled to Washington Square Arch, where that early autumn sunlight, softened by wisps of clouds, hung lazily over the crowds, I almost believed I was standing beneath Milan's Arch of Peace. One could say New York possesses a Milanese atmosphere; or perhaps it's entirely the reverse—that Milan unexpectedly carries New York's flavor.
Yet it doesn't stop there. On Greenwich's broad avenues, the way the broad leaves of street trees flutter in the wind can suddenly evoke thoughts of Paris... New York is like the reflection off glass—depending on the angle of observation, it always manages to present similarities to other cities. Though indeed, New York, Paris, and Milan share an unspoken commonality: a certain inheritance that extends from cities prematurely matured in some dimension. Multi-ethnic living atmospheres grounded in classical grid or radial street layouts, blended with contemporary stylistic trends. Unlike Florence, which has been completely altered by tourist saturation into a contrived antiquity, the old-world character of New York or Milan hasn't become a sight for worship, but rather a backdrop thoroughly integrated into residents' daily routines; or conversely, modern populations inhabit without incongruity this old city that was completely constructed before the turn of the century.
Standing on those streets of Times Square that struck me as both solemn and exhilarating with their chiming bells, watching the surrounding billboards display all too clamorously a lifestyle that abruptly shifts from dazzling to nothing—I thought that the "restless vitality impatient with old catchwords" surrounding Gatsby, that "too abrupt fate of running from zero to zero along a shortcut," hadn't become jazz-like wailing ruins with the wasteland era's recovery; quite the contrary, whether the stories continuously unfolding in this district today or this stage and its scenery, they remain exactly as they were a century ago. The only change is that the characters on stage now wear garments more fitting to this era's flamboyance and speak words more suited to this age's directness.
What you can sense is that cities like New York, Milan, or Paris are not entirely possessed by humans, but grow slowly at their own pace, by their own inertia, or rather, rust (this still differs from Tokyo's devouring mode of existence). Their towering presence and the sense of existence that looks down upon all else isn't because people live here, but as if they should stand here by way of self-evidence—yet as for what kinds of people come and go on this land, and at what rate they alternate and age—the city itself doesn't care.
Like artworks carved with different patterns under the same type of cross-section, people and eras wash over these streets whose appearance has hardly changed, leaving behind memories large and small that have been crystallized—those are the sculptures or art installations tucked into corners that one encounters unexpectedly. They absorb perhaps the entire era's character into themselves and nestle quietly in a nook (John Lennon has been condensed into "Imagine" in a corner of Central Park), maintaining the simple dignity of what remains... Thus, when every street begins to crowd with increasingly heavy memories, what people can do, besides remembrance and strengthening this remembrance with original works, is nothing else; and these arts that transform remembrance into inspiration, no matter how breakthrough they may be, still cannot achieve a subversion of this birthplace, but are instead absorbed and precipitated, ultimately becoming part of this city...

When culture itself becomes the foundation, culture no longer grows as budding flowers, but becomes the increasingly thick soil—and this is precisely the dream-like fervor I smell in these cities, the desire to become geological strata.
Therefore, if Beijing's spatial fragmentation reveals a certain folding, then New York's temporal continuity reveals a certain sedimentation.
In sum, if the essence of humanity is to be a repeating machine, then every moment of history should rightfully be a unique repetition.

从车子自三区大桥驶入曼哈顿开始，我就恍然有种身在米兰的错觉，而这并不是因为我们进入小意大利的缘故。造成这种错觉的因素：世贸中心以辉煌的玻璃装潢映入眼界的Eataly；或者地下铁——完全以其功能形式展现出来的双向隧道，以纯粹运力为建造标准的车厢，毫无生色的砖墙上涂鸦和污渍的反叛，无不显示出两个城市间令人震惊的同调。尤其是，当我漫步至华盛顿拱门的时候，那种初秋因云絮荫庇而显得温软的阳光正懒洋洋地耷拉在人群身上，让我几乎以为自己正身在米兰的和平门下。可以说，纽约具有一种米兰的气氛；也可能完全相反，那就是米兰意外地带有纽约的风味。

当然并不仅于此，格林威治的宽阔大街上，行道树的阔叶随风飘动的情致也会突然令人想起巴黎……可以说，纽约如同玻璃的反光，因为观测角度的不同，总能呈现出一种和其他城市的相似——虽然，纽约、巴黎以及米兰之间也的确有着不言而喻的共通性：那是在某个维度中过早成熟的城市的某种遗产般的绵延。以古典的十字或放射型街区为底蕴的多种族的生活气息，混搭上具有当代特色格调的潮流。与佛罗伦萨这种因游客密布而完全变味的古朴相反，纽约或米兰的老派并未成为一种用于参拜的景致，而是幕后彻底融进居民日常的寻常图景；或相反，是现代人群毫无违和感地寓居在了这座世纪前就被搭建完整的老城。

踏上时代广场那片因敲钟而给我以庄严和兴奋的街道上，看着四周的广告牌位过于喧嚣地展示一种从璀璨戛然而止的生活方式——我想，盖茨比周遭那种“不安于陈旧辞令的粗犷活力”，那种“沿着一条捷径从零跑到零的过分突兀的命运”，并未随着荒原时代的重新振作而变成爵士乐般呜咽的遗迹；恰恰相反，如今在这个街区中不间断地上演的故事也好，这个舞台与布景也好，都和百年前别无二致 。唯一变更的，不过是登场的人物们穿起了更贴合这个时代的张扬衣物，言语出更贴合这个时代的直率词句罢了。

你可以感受到的一点是，像纽约、米兰或巴黎这些城市，它们并不完全被人类所拥有，而是以自己的脉率，自顾自地以惯性慢慢地成长，或者说，锈蚀（这和东京那种吞噬性的存在方式仍然有所区别）。它们的矗立与此而睥睨他物的存在感，并不是因为这里有人在居住，而仿佛它们以自证的方式本应伫立在此——但至于这片土地上究竟来来往往什么样的人群，而他们又以怎样的速率更迭和衰老——它自是不在乎的。

就如同在同种切片下雕镂出不同花纹的艺术品一样，人群和时代如流水般从这些外观几乎不曾变更的街道上冲刷而过，残剩下大大小小的被固化的记忆，而那就是在蜷踞在转角处的给人不经意撞见的雕塑或某些艺术装置。它们将也许是整个时代的风貌纳入自身并安静地窝于一隅（约翰列侬就被浓缩为中央公园一角的“想象力”），保持着残剩者简洁的矜持……就这样，当每一条街道都开始拥挤着越来越厚重的回忆，那么人们所能做的，除了缅怀和以独创性的作品加强这种缅怀，便别无他法；而这些将缅怀变作灵感的艺术，无论多么具有突破性，仍然无法实现对这个发祥地的颠覆，转而被吸纳而沉淀，最终成为这个城市的一部分……

如果文化本身成为了地基，文化就不再会是发芽的花朵，而是越积越厚的泥土，而这正是我在这些城市中所嗅到的想要成为地层的梦想般的热烈。

因此，如果说北京空间上的割裂展现出了某种折叠，那么纽约时间上一以贯之的延续则展现出了某种层积。

一言以蔽之，如果人类的本质是复读机，那么历史的每个瞬间理所应当都是独特的重复。
