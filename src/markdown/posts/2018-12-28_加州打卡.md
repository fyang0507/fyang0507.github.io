### (I)
California is less a modern living area than it is a modern colony.
It fundamentally lacks a sense of lived-in warmth—that feeling of people genuinely inhabiting a place—so people here don't seem to live here through and through. A more apt description of this mode of existence would be that, depending on circumstances, the residents here either swagger about plundering, dominate with grand airs, lie low discreetly, or rustlingly bide their time for opportunities.
By all rights, as a coastline blessed by heaven with splendid climate, it should possess an inherent attraction—migratory birds should winter here. But the mobility represented by the word "wintering" precisely reflects the enormous difference between "living in California" and "having lived in California" in one's self-introduction. That is to say, though this place constantly churns with flocking crowds drawn by various endowments and miracles, after the waves recede, nothing settles in the city.
The fact is, as a city that suddenly swelled during the gold rush, it still carries within its core the spirit of chasing wealth. This unvarnished, straightforward culture of wealth, ironically enough, is also the source of vigorous vitality in these cities. As a spiritual legacy of this gold-seeking mentality, I think most residents share, to varying degrees, a rarely articulated consensus (though certain groups proudly call themselves "Silicon Valley people")—that this place is not accepted by people as a universal "homeland." Thus, this mode of existence as a transit station gives the city a sinfully alluring charm that allows people to continue their wanton ways with peace of mind.
In other words, California is treated by people as some kind of journey.

### (II)
My dream of Silicon Valley, beyond its cutting-edge technology, should simultaneously possess a humanistic sense of the future: it would represent future modes of interaction between people, and between humans and nature—from the fragments I've read and heard, I imagined that people here possess a natural mode of striving: first, their lives revere natural beauty; second, their work conforms to natural patterns of interaction.
But what I saw during my pilgrimage was that the barrenness of the land itself and the scattered tribal feel among clusters of tech companies form a peculiar landscape: those buildings rising from desolate slopes are, in a sense, precisely the scattered colonial outposts that people have planted on some planet. They each form enclave-like divisions with a rather autonomous air. The indifference to surroundings born from this sheltered isolation manifests once again as the kind of elite refinement I most detest. And this is the true meaning of this sacred land.
Indeed, "advancement" comes with its price. The breakthrough nature represented by the spirit of innovation inevitably contains maddening elements—as the region that first legalized marijuana, people here also seem particularly adept at creating chaos and mayhem. In this blatant law of the jungle, the last thing that self-preserving individuals need is universal harmony.
Therefore, the sense of the future possessed by Silicon Valley, which believes in Pareto principles, is particularly realistic.

### (III)
Melrose Avenue has pink walls and graffiti, Koreatown has trendy Korean cuisine, Griffith Park offers views of Hollywood's giant sign... Thus, Los Angeles is a city perfectly suited for check-ins. But beyond this, it really has no other praiseworthy qualities.
The doors of detached houses are tightly locked, immigrants with accents have developed an intense wariness, as if constantly guarding against potential malicious intentions from the crisis-ridden crowds (every gas station restroom cunningly bears a "out of order" sign!). When you smile at pedestrians, you can sense their great astonishment at such unprovoked kindness. Meanwhile, the scorching traffic flow on the roadways—traffic that treats the speed limit as the minimum driving speed—rudely embodies an arrogance squeezed into shape by vigilance.
If San Francisco's uninhabitability manifests in its lack of "homeland" atmosphere, Los Angeles's restlessness stems from a lack of integration. It can be said that these check-in worthy locations are completely and utterly grouped under this city's name simply because they happen to be geographically proximate, despite each having different souls. I gaze at the various graffiti—they are entirely random, casual creations lacking any seriousness, completely missing a consistent cultural core. This disorder as an "arts district" reveals Los Angeles's character as a canvas for anyone to paint on—only people who know they won't settle here dare to wield their brushes so boldly without hesitation. You can imagine that if this creation loses its artistic quality, it would become as avoidable as psoriasis, though their essence is merely chaotic information that cares nothing for the neighborhood's appearance and development.
In this sense, the City of Angels is both a blessed place and an abandoned place.
Perhaps all of California is.

加州这地方与其说是个现代化的生活区毋宁说是个现代化的殖民地。

它到底缺乏一种乡土气，所以人们在这里不似彻头彻尾地生活。对这种存在方式更妥帖的说法是，依据情况不同，这里的居民招摇地扫荡、大模大样地制霸、低调地蛰伏、或者窸窸窣窣地伺机而动着。

按理说，作为承蒙天恩而抱拥明媚气候的海岸线，它理所应当拥有一种内在的吸引力——候鸟应当在此越冬。但“越冬”这个词所代表的流动性，也正好体现出自我介绍中“在加州生活”和“在加州生活过”之间巨大的差异。就是说，这里虽因为各种天赋和奇迹而不停攒动着趋之若鹜的人流，但浪潮过后，城市中却什么也没有沉淀下来。

事实就是，作为一个自淘金热潮中倏而膨胀起来的城市，其内里到底还是带有逐富的意味。而这种不饰措辞的直来直往的财富文化，令人感到讽刺的是，居然也是这些城市中蓬勃朝气的来源。作为这种淘金的精神遗产，我想，大多数居民都或多或少都拥有这样一种鲜被言说的共识（尽管其中某群会自豪地管自己这一伙叫做“硅谷人”），那就是这里并不被人们接纳为普遍的“家园”——于是，这种作为中转站般存在的方式让这个城市拥有了让人心安理得地继续放肆下去的罪孽般的魅力。

也就是说，加州被人们当做了某种旅途。

我梦想中的硅谷，除了其尖端的技术之外，应该同时具备一种人文主义的未来感：它将代表人与人、人与自然的未来的互动方式——在我读到和听到的只言片语中，我猜想，这里的人们拥有一种自然的奋斗模式：首先、他们的生活是崇尚自然风貌的；其次，他们的工作是符合自然的交互模式的。

但我在巡礼的旅途中看到的是，这片土地本身的贫瘠和一簇簇科技公司间参差的部落感构成一种奇妙的图景：那些自荒凉的坡道上拔地而起的楼宇，从某种意义上说，正是人们在某个行星上种植下的星星点点的殖民地。它们各自形成一个个租界样的划分，颇有种自治的意味。而那种从被庇护的隔绝中生出的对周遭的淡漠感，则再次展现为一种我最为厌恶的精英的精致性。而这才是这片圣地的真意。

没错，“先进”自是有其代价的。创新精神所代表的突破性中必然也含有令人癫狂的因子——作为率先将大麻合法化的地区，这里的人们也似乎特别擅长制造混乱和狼藉——在这种昭然若揭的丛林法则中，独善其身的人们最不需要的就是大同。

因此，信仰帕累托的硅谷所拥有未来感也特别具有现实性。

梅尔罗斯大道有粉墙和涂鸦，KTown有网红的韩国料理，格里菲斯公园可以眺望好莱坞巨大的标牌……因此，洛杉矶是个极适合打卡的城市。但除此以外，它也实在没有其他值得称道的地方了。

独栋的洋楼房门紧锁，操着口音的移民也生出了一种强烈的戒备心，仿佛时刻防范着危机四伏的人群中可能出现的图谋不轨（每个加油站的卫生间都狡猾地立着“故障”的标牌！），向行人微笑，你可以感到他们对这种没来由的善意大感诧异；而车道上滚烫的车流，以最高限速为最低行车速度的车流，则分外粗鲁地体现出一种被戒备压榨成型的傲慢。

如果说旧金山的不宜居留体现在其“家园”氛围的缺乏上，洛杉矶浮躁的成因则是缺乏融合感造成的。可以说，这些值得打卡的地点完完全全是恰巧因为地理位置接近，而权且被归在了这个城市的名下，尽管它们各自都有着不同的灵魂。我望向那些各色的涂鸦，它们彻底就是随机出现的毫无严肃感的随性的创作，完全缺失一种一以贯之的文化内核。这种作为“艺术街区”的杂乱，展现出洛杉矶可以任人涂抹的画布的特性——也只有深知自己不会在此安家的人们，才敢于如此毫不畏首畏尾地挥笔。你可以想象，这种创作如果失去其艺术性，将会和牛皮藓一样变得令人避之不及，虽然它们的本质都是毫不在乎街区容貌和成长的杂乱资讯而已。

从这中意义上讲，天使之城既是被祝福的地方，也是被遗弃的地方。

也许整个加州都是。
