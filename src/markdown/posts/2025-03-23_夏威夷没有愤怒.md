The battleship USS Missouri, which missed the entire Pearl Harbor attack, now rests moored in the calm waters of the inner harbor. The wreckage of her sister ship Arizona—which suffered the most devastating casualties—lies just over a hundred meters ahead of her bow.
Every quarter hour, a guide leads a new group of visitors strolling along the ship's rail: we gaze up at the massive gun barrels pointing toward the sky, look down at the deck boards once walked upon by the Japanese surrender delegation, and read a placard about a burial at sea ceremony.
—On April 11, 1945, during the Battle of Okinawa, Captain William Callaghan ordered his crew to give a kamikaze pilot a military burial at sea with full honors. Thus Setsuo Ishino became the only Japanese soldier in World War II to receive a military funeral from Allied forces. Some say this represents humanity, respect, and honor between soldiers, but I know another answer.
William Callaghan missed the entire Pearl Harbor attack. William Callaghan had no anger.

After the air raid, the Pacific Fleet was jumpy and paranoid: so many of these brown-skinned residents had Asian faces, and among them up to 150,000 carried suspicious Japanese bloodlines! What followed was a sweep of arrests, detention, concentration camps, and massive military control; if you looked Japanese, then you were a "Jap"...
Hawaii was merely a U.S. territory at the time, not a state (that would have to wait until 1959), but this didn't prevent the spread of curfews and discrimination. These residents watched helplessly as their towns became military bases, then were inexplicably bombed by Japanese forces, and finally were detained in concentration camps. How unfair it all was, but what could they say? This was, after all, a war where justice had to triumph over evil! As for why evil came calling unexpectedly...
Hawaii's residents submitted to American rule. Hawaii's residents had no anger.

On March 9, 2025, Waikiki Beach was more lively than usual. The 29th Honolulu Festival was in full swing. I just couldn't quite tell whether this celebration was truly what its organizers claimed—a festival celebrating Hawaiian and Pacific Rim culture—or essentially a Japanese matsuri. What I saw were bilingual English-Japanese festival banners, young girls dancing cheerfully to Japanese pop music, mikoshi and floats, and the festival's finale calling for peace: a Nagaoka Fireworks Festival fireworks show.
(Interestingly, the Nagaoka Fireworks Festival happened to be an event that began in Nagaoka City, Niigata Prefecture, in the first year after Japan's surrender, to commemorate those who died in World War II. And coincidentally, Honolulu and Nagaoka became sister cities.)
Many people have much to say about promoting peace, but it shouldn't be the perpetrators speaking to the victims, the aggressors to the invaded, the colonizers to the colonized. I'm curious: this world's most famous beach is only a 20-minute drive from the U.S. military's most humiliating scar, many tourists visit both places in a single day—what exactly is this harmony all about? What kind of identity do these people who speak equally fluent Japanese and English actually have?
I know someone will say it's rare to be confused, let the past be the past.
Indeed so.
After all, Hawaii has no anger either.

When Captain James Cook arrived in Hawaii, it was during Makahiki season, precisely when the local natives were celebrating Lono—the god of agriculture, harvest, and peace. This coincidental timing of his landing led the Hawaiians to revere Captain Cook as a deity.
When the captain appeared for the second time, they were no longer pleased. The festival and worship had ended—why had he returned? So Cook fell from divinity and was killed by Hawaiian warriors.
Cook was indeed not Lono, but he possessed the same divine power and divine punishment: the plagues and missionaries who followed in his footsteps killed ninety percent of Hawaiians over the next century, and raised the Christian cross at this Pacific crossroads.
Hawaiians historically never practiced isolationism: Hawaiian chiefs used Western weapons to win tribal wars, Hawaiian queens promoted Western faith and culture to replace traditional religion and customs, but this keeping with the times didn't help them escape more of their destined fate. In 1893, a queen who tried to secure more rights for the natives was overthrown by plantation owners, ending nearly a century of monarchical rule over these islands; five years later, the Newlands Resolution from Washington, D.C., made a declaration for all Hawaiians 8,000 kilometers away: Hawaii was American territory.
Then came massive immigration: Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese, Korean, Filipino... Within just over a decade, Hawaii's population doubled. And half a century later, it was the descendants of these very immigrants who pushed America to recognize it as the fiftieth state of the United States. This annexed Pacific kingdom finally found its place within the Constitution.
Only by then, you could no longer clearly say who were the "locals" of Hawaii.

According to ancient legend, taking stones from Hawaii without permission brings bad luck, but if you buy them from locals, that's another matter entirely.
Meanwhile, tourists freely hike and watch sunrises and sunsets on Haleakalā volcano, even though in true Hawaiian culture, the only reason to ascend the sacred mountain is to worship the gods.

According to some fences and warning signs, certain ponds or beaches cannot be casually visited—only locals can swim in the water.
Meanwhile, tourists drink merrily at luau feasts, watching locals perform exaggerated Polynesian war cries and hula dances on stage.

According to travel guidebook advice, when driving the Road to Hana, one should be mindful of yielding to local vehicles and pull over promptly to let them pass.
Meanwhile, the 2023 Lahaina fire destroyed eighty percent of locals' homes, reconstruction is slow, but adjacent resorts bustle with crowds.

The flag of the Kingdom of Hawaii flutters defiantly everywhere across these United States islands. Meanwhile, 160,000 new American tourists land daily with their sunglasses and Hawaiian shirts.

Who needs condescending respect? Who truly owns Hawaii?

In Hana's pristine forests, bamboo saplings brought by Chinese laborers have grown rampant into lush bamboo groves. Indian banyan trees planted to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Pilgrims' landing stand firm, providing shade for all. On the windy peaks of the volcano park, chukar partridges introduced from Asia forage in parking lot gaps. These invasive species live here contentedly, sometimes overly bold, turning guest into host.
But capitalism is the real master here.
Thirty-seven wealthy Americans own private lands exceeding 5% of the state's total land area, with Larry Ellison (Oracle's founder) alone owning 98% of Lanai Island. (At sunset, viewed from Maui's west shore, Lanai Island's massive shadow looks like a shroud draped over Lahaina. What did Larry do after that great fire? From public records, he did nothing.)
A century ago, the Big Five plantation cartel collectively owned over 10% of the total area. That was a period of dramatic change in Hawaii's landscape: the disappearance of native species and forest scenery, replaced by endless sugarcane fields, pineapple farms, countless cattle... Until tourism's rise, only then did people remember ecological fragility, rare species, environmental protection. So golf courses arrived fashionably late as the final victors, yet bloomed across mountains and valleys. Today, looking down at Maui from an airplane, those plains half meadow and half desert look like stubborn wounds that refuse to heal.
It's hard to describe Hawaii as scarred, because life never disappoints those abundant rains and sunshine.
It's just that whatever Pele the goddess cannot save, Uncle Sam will make even worse.

In a corner of the Sunday market next to Honolulu Zoo, two men who looked like brothers had set up a tent selling handicrafts. They were darkly tanned by the sun, with Asian faces, both seemingly in their fifties. The younger brother sat in a simple chair polishing a wood carving, while the older brother, wearing flip-flops and a camouflage baseball cap, greeted customers.
But there weren't really any customers. At eight in the morning, tourists' snores hadn't yet turned into clamor, many vendors in the market were still setting up their displays, with morning light sparsely dripping through leaf gaps.
The wood carvings they sold weren't the identical shamanic figures commonly displayed in souvenir shops, but various decorations clearly handmade by self-taught craftsmen. We were drawn to a flying pig ornament. These three wooden piglets were carved quite roughly, with no coloring, strung together like wind chimes hanging from the tent's frame. Each pig had three bird feathers stuck in its rear.
March in Hawaii is typically a windy time. When the wind rose, these feathers spun in the breeze. The ornament had no bells, yet I seemed to hear the clear sound of wind chimes.
We bought these rough little pigs. When the owner stood on his toes to take them down, I noticed he was slightly cross-eyed, which gave him an honest appearance. As I write these words, these little pigs are spinning by our window—March in New York is windy too.
Every time I walk past these little pigs, I can't help but stop and blow on them, watching their feathers rustle and spin. Each time I gain some strength and some emotion.
I think I've said many bad things about Hawaii. I believe approaching Hawaii with a vacation mindset misses the point. But staying too long in these historical folds and cultural overlays will eventually make one choke and grow cold.
Hawaii has no anger, perhaps because even when life grows heavy, there remains a small yet warm and powerful way of living. It's these ordinary things that sustain us, and sustain the earth's steady rotation.

错过了整个珍珠港事件的密苏里号战列舰如今停泊在风平浪静的内湾中，它伤亡最为惨烈的姊妹号亚利桑那的残骸就躺在它船首前方百余米处。

每隔一刻钟，向导带领新一批登船的游客在船舷上溜达：我们望向直指天空的巨大炮筒，俯看日本投降代表团踩过的船板，以及一个海葬仪式的示意牌。

——1945年4月11日的冲绳战役，舰长威廉·卡拉汉命令船员以军队的仪仗标准海葬了一个神风战机的驾驶员，于是石野节雄成为了二战中唯一一个被盟军举行军事葬礼的日本兵。有人说这代表人性、尊重和军人之间的敬意，而我知道另一个答案。

威廉·卡拉汉错过了整个珍珠港事件。威廉·卡拉汉没有愤怒。



空袭过后，太平洋舰队杯弓蛇影：这些棕色皮肤的居民好多都是亚洲面孔，其中多达十五万人携带可疑的日本血统！接下来就是搜捕、拘留、集中营、大规模的军事管制；如果你长得像日本人，那你就是日本佬（Japs）……

夏威夷当时仅仅是美国的领土而不是一个州（这要等到1959年），但这并不影响宵禁和歧视的蔓延。这些居民眼睁睁看着自己的镇子变成军事基地，然后莫名其妙被日军轰炸，最后被关押到集中营里。好不公平啊，但你能说什么呢？这毕竟是正义必须战胜邪恶的战争啊！至于为什么邪恶会不期而至……

夏威夷的居民服从美国的管理。夏威夷的居民没有愤怒。



2025年3月9日，威基基海滩比平日更为热烈。第29届檀香山节（Honolulu Festival ）声势浩大。我只是有些分不清这个庆典到底是如它官方所说——一个[关于夏威夷和太平洋周边地区文化的节日](https://www.honolulufestival.com/en/festival/)，或者根本就是一个日式的祭典。我看见的是英日双语的节日横幅，是年轻女孩们跟着日本流行音乐跳起的轻快舞蹈，是神轿和花车，是庆典最后“呼吁和平”的名为長岡花火大会焰火秀。

（有趣的是，長岡花火大会恰好是新潟縣長岡市在[日本投降后的第一年，为了纪念二战中死去的人们而开始的活动](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/256/)。偏偏火奴鲁鲁和長岡又成了友好城市。）

关于促进和平，很多人都有很多话可以说，但就是不应该施难者对着受难者，侵略者对着被侵略者，殖民者对着被殖民者说。我很好奇，这个世界最著名的海滩距离美军最屈辱的伤疤不过20分钟车程，很多游客一天内在两个地方打来回，这种和谐到底算是怎么一回事？这些说着同样流利日语和英文的人们身份认同到底是什么样子？

我知道有人要说难得糊涂，过去的就让它过去吧。

确实如此。

反正夏威夷也没有愤怒。

詹姆斯·库克船长到达夏威夷时正值玛卡希基节（Makahiki），这正是当地土著庆祝洛诺（Lono）——农业、丰收与和平之神的时候。这巧合的登录节点让夏威夷人将库克船长奉为神明。

船长第二次出现时他们却不高兴了。节日和侍奉已经结束，他又为什么要回来？于是库克堕入凡间，被夏威夷战士杀死。

库克确实不是洛诺，但他一样拥有神的力量和神的惩罚：那些跟随他的脚步上岸的瘟疫和传教士们，在之后的一个世纪杀死了九成的夏威夷人，又在这个太平洋的十字路口升腾起基督的十字。

夏威夷人历史上没有闭关锁国：夏威夷的酋长们借助西方的武器赢的部落战争，夏威夷的女王推行西方的信仰和文化替代传统的宗教和观念，但这些与时俱进并没有让他们逃逸出更多的命中注定。1893年，试图为土著争取更多权力的女王被种植园主推翻，了结了这些岛屿近百年的君主统治；五年后，源自华盛顿特区的纽兰兹决议替所有8000公里外的夏威夷人做出声明：夏威夷是美国的领地。

然后它迎来了大规模的移民：日本，中国，葡萄牙，韩国，菲律宾……十余年间，夏威夷的人口暴涨一倍。而半个世纪后，正是这些移民的后代推动美国承认它成为美利坚合众国的第五十州。这个被吞并的太平洋王国，终于在宪法之内找到了位置。

只是这时候，你已经和难说清楚，谁才是夏威夷的“本地人”了。

根据古老的传说，私自带走夏威夷的石头会招来厄运，但如果从本地人手中买下的话就另当别论。

与此同时，游客在哈莱阿卡拉火山（Haleakalā）上任意徒步和观看日出日落，尽管在真正的夏威夷文化中，登上圣山的唯一理由是祭祀神灵。



根据一些拉上的围栏和竖起的警示，有些池塘或海滩不可贸然光顾，只有本地人可以下水游泳。

与此同时，游客在鲁奥宴会（Luau）上怡然饮酒，看着本地人在舞台上表演波利尼西亚夸张的战吼和草裙舞。



根据旅行手册的建议，哈纳之路上行车时应注意避让本地车辆，及时靠边让行。

与此同时，2023年拉海纳的大火烧毁了本地人百分之八十的居所，重建工作缓慢，但相邻的度假村人声鼎沸。



夏威夷王国的旗帜在合众国的岛屿上到处耀武扬威地猎猎作响。与此同时，每天都有16万新的美国游客拿出自己的墨镜和夏威夷衬衫登陆旅行。

谁需要居高临下的尊重？谁真正拥有夏威夷？

哈纳的原始森林里，中国劳工带来的竹苗闹腾得蹿成了一片郁郁的竹林。为纪念清教徒登陆50周年而种下的印度榕树屹立不倒荫庇一方。火山公园多风的山顶，自亚洲引进的石鸡在停车场的间隙低头觅食。这些外来物种在这里生活得怡然自得，有时过分嚣张，反客为主。

但资本主义才是这里真正的主人。

[37个美国富豪拥有的私人领地超过全州土地面积的5%](https://www.forbeschina.com/city/67247)，其中仅拉里·埃里森（甲骨文创始人）一人就拥有98%的拉奈岛。（夕照时分，从茂宜的西岸望去，拉奈岛巨大的阴影像给拉海纳披上一件丧衣。那场大火过后拉里做了什么呢？从公开资料看，他什么都没有做。）

而一个世纪前，五大种植业的卡特尔的土地面积合计[超过总体的10%](https://chatgpt.com/share/67dee245-3504-8012-81d5-59cf1f10e879)。那是夏威夷风貌急剧变化的时期：本地物种和森林景观的消失，取而代之以一望无际的甘蔗田、菠萝农场、数不胜数的黄牛……直到旅游业的兴起，人们这才想起生态脆弱、珍稀物种、环境保护。于是高尔夫球场以最后的胜利者的姿势姗姗来迟，却开得漫山遍野。如今从飞机上俯瞰茂宜岛，那些半是草甸半是荒漠的平原像是固执的不肯愈合的创伤。

很难用疮痍来形容夏威夷，因为生命不会辜负那些丰沛的雨水和阳光。

只是，但凡佩蕾女神拯救不了的东西，山姆大叔就会变本加厉。

檀香山动物园旁边的周日集市的一个角落，看上去像兄弟的两人支着一个蓬子在售卖手工艺品。他们被日光晒得黝黑，亚洲面孔，似乎都是五十岁上下。弟弟坐在一把简陋的椅子上正在给一个木雕抛光，哥哥穿着拖鞋戴一顶迷彩的棒球招呼客人。

但并没有什么客人。清晨八点，游人的呼噜还没有变成喧嚣，集市里不少卖家还在布置自己的台面，只是晨光稀稀疏疏地从叶缝间滴落。

他们卖的木雕并不是纪念品店里面常常陈列的大同小异的萨满像，而一看便知是自学成才的匠人手工的各式装饰。我们被一个飞天小猪的吊饰吸引住了。这三只木头小猪被雕得很简陋，没有任何涂色，它们被线串成一串，像风铃一样被挂在蓬子的支架上。每只小猪的屁股后面都插着三叶鸟羽。

三月的夏威夷本是多风的时候。风起时，这些羽毛迎风转起来。吊饰上没有任何铃铛，而我却能恍然听见清脆的风铃声。

我们买下了这些粗糙的小猪。老板踮着脚去摘下它的时候，我才看出他有些对眼，因此也显出憨厚的样子。就在我写下这些文字的时候，这些小猪正在我们的窗前滴溜溜地转着，三月的纽约也是多风的。

我每次从小猪前面走过的时候，总忍不住停下来对着它们吹气，看着它们的羽毛簌簌转动，我都能获得一些力量和一些感动。

我想，我说了好多夏威夷的坏话。我以为以度假的心态去夏威夷是不得要领的。但呆在这些历史褶皱和文化叠影中太久，人总会呛水和失温。

夏威夷没有愤怒，也可以是因为就算日子再过沉重，仍然有一种渺小却不失温暖和力量的活法，正是这些平凡的东西支撑着我们，也支撑着地球平稳转动。
