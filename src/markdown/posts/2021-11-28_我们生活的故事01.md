### (Preface)
Since that summer night twelve years ago when I first faced my wounds directly, I have maintained this urge to express myself once a year, recording the evolution of my thoughts over the past year.
In 2009, when Evangelion's new theatrical version "Break" was released, its celebrated insert song "Tsubasa wo Kudasai" accompanied me through writing the previous twelve pieces. Also stemming from these memories was their inexplicably titled collection "The Silence of Lies."
This year, with the final chapter themed around farewell bringing closure to this mythological system I once believed in wholeheartedly, I've decided—out of responsibility to this one-sided romance that began in my youth—to give these future summaries a new name.
From expressing subjective feelings (mainly self-pity), to proclaiming ideas I thought were uniquely mine, to making partial and declarative generalizations about trends, and finally beginning to record and reflect on specific events—following this written trail, these markers perfectly reflect a young person's gradual process of "seeing" from inside out, becoming more adept at managing and applying their emotions while turning their gaze toward understanding the world's complexity, ruthlessness, and entanglements.
Without these records, I might soon feel puzzled by that youth who championed loneliness, refused reconciliation, gazed at his own endowed sensitivity, and focused solely on inner experience—because this would be so different from you! Because now you are submerged in ordinariness, striving to remain objective, possessing a measured curiosity about truth—though the undertone of this curiosity may be sadness and helplessness.
But sincerity remains unchanged. You never lie to yourself. Even hidden in the crowd, you still make efforts to create something insignificant.
You know that even the most just history is a form of narrative, and your life—as Strand wrote in his poem—is the story of your life.

*It's impossible to say in what form*
*the weather will appear.*
*We blow on our hands,*
*trying to keep them warm.*

### (I)
Many art forms, including photography, experienced a developmental process in the twentieth century that moved "from external to internal, from process to fragment, from narrative to lyrical, from restraining passion to stimulating senses." This process, from a positive perspective, liberated art from the constraints of objective frameworks, making subjective feelings and emotional expression something neither shameful nor worthy of boasting, and making human aesthetics more diverse and open. In terms of trends, artistic motivation has generally become increasingly privatized; artistic purpose is no longer clear, and standards for artistic judgment have become blurred.
Among these, photography is distinctive. Unlike large oil paintings and small decorative paintings, large symphonies and small chamber music—art forms that can make viewers clearly feel the difference in creative costs—photographs are almost equal to each other. Especially benefiting from the widespread adoption of portable shooting devices, the instantaneous production process of pressing the shutter, and the ubiquitous digital viewing methods, photography has the lowest threshold among artistic media, both in terms of production and consumption.
The tendency toward popularization naturally leads to numerous schools in the photography market, or rather, a mixed bag; while respecting diversity, I still maintain my own aesthetic judgment and suspect the blind inertia of group trends. That is to say, in this current moment when the importance of personal narrative is elevated to an unnecessary height, I consistently believe that art (including photography) must achieve content over form, substance over style.
Personal narrative in photography manifests in two trends: first, the excessive emphasis and modification of subjects in check-in photos with monotonous filters; second, the metaphorical expression of emotions through stacking abstract colors commonly seen in so-called artistic photography. These two narratives carry different personal characteristics (the former like dancing under a spotlight, the latter like reading poetry at a recital). While not all personal narratives desperately crave attention, the core of both narratives remains connected—they are both manifestations of narcissism.
Narcissism is the trend of our times. Though I can't tell whether this era is more narcissistic, or because everyone can become media, we hear more narcissistic voices.
This is also a restless era. We play videos at double speed, yet end up remembering nothing and understanding nothing.
Narcissism plus restlessness—this is certainly the best of times for photography as art.

### (II)
But photography as a technical means (recording external moments with photosensitive elements) is inherently non-artistic. I consider this parallel relationship with art as my photography philosophy.
The uniqueness of photography lies in the fact that, unless deliberately staging scenes, its material comes entirely from reality itself. The photographer does not construct scenes but intercepts them—both temporally and spatially.
A photograph can be seen as an independent entity that cannot show the changes of the photographed object before and after shooting (temporally), nor express any events outside the frame (spatially). But this fixation of moments does not prevent viewers from using logic and common sense to reconstruct temporal and spatial possibilities in reverse—this is the manifestation of photography's metaphorical nature.
Indeed, the objective limitations of the medium restrict the photographer's creation (I cannot photograph a building at noon while expressing its nighttime appearance), but conversely, this documentary realism is photography's unique characteristic. That is to say, what photography should record and display is **life itself**.
American street photographer Winogrand once said he took pictures to "see what things look like when photographed." This statement can be interpreted in multiple ways, but from any angle, "what things look like when photographed" differs from "what things look like in the photographer's eyes" in contemporary mainstream photographic language.
Establishing correct aesthetics requires understanding the historical context of beauty rather than relying on current trends, but this is no easy task. Just as many people mistake popular music for music itself, the lens language of commercial and landscape photography is often misunderstood as all of photography: with formal beauty as the guide, photographs should record the most ideal (rather than most typical or real) appearance of things. By extension, when people hope to find sufficient justification for their narcissism, they naturally hope to use photography to achieve their **transcendence** of life in photographs.
Good photographs follow the order of reality, inevitability, and legendarity. Bad photographs rely entirely on the logic that "photographs are known to be unable to lie."
A real Eiffel Tower should damn well look like it's in Paris, not Las Vegas. And those passing by the Seine near the tower know that what the wind stirs up and blows away is dust everywhere, not confession balloons.

### (III)
A person's photo album is that person's narcissism index.
Not knowing how to take photos isn't a problem; being too good at showing yourself is a big problem.
Don't be narcissistic, and everything else can be discussed. To correct narcissism, one must first start by rejecting shallow emotions and hollow refinement.

### (IV)
Here is everything a person needs to survive, perhaps more—as long as you lower your expectations! Among all the congested Manhattan streets I've walked, nowhere is more New York or less New York than East Broadway in Chinatown (or officially, the Chinese Quarter).
Here, on the elevated track heading from Manhattan to Queens, four subway lines—B, D, N, Q—heavily pass overhead, bringing not only unbearable noise but occasionally unidentified precipitation from between the rails.
Though constrained in height by this bridge, the tenacious East Broadway Mall still shelters numerous grocery stores: cell phone card vendors, bird's nest sellers, marriage agencies, and its own daughter: the five-star restaurant East Broadway Mall Restaurant. But below this restaurant's sign are two other jewelry stores and a bakery.
At the street corner, a woman selling fruit beside a stall is fumbling with a roll of plastic bags. Tropical fruits droop in the autumn cold wind but are not marked down for sale. Though there are no signs, in areas where Chinese Americans gather, cash is always the highest priority payment method.
Right next to the intersection, there's an even smaller shop with a sign for China-US package delivery service, but the storefront is piled with various snacks, cigarettes, and suspiciously packaged masks. The old man inside, constrained by the counter in front and the wall behind, can only move horizontally and turn around, but this has also trained him in a unique skill: consuming life in statue-like stillness at this busy intersection.
Heading west, the road becomes more cramped. But surface dimness doesn't tell the whole story: Eastern culture always prefers to keep things hidden, so this is a land of hidden dragons and crouching tigers. Orient Photo Company uses a huge wedding photo to block the fire escape of a residential building, while in the five-story Western-style building next door, from top to bottom are: Oriental Arts Training Center, Chinese Social Democratic Party office, tax and insurance services, and dermatology and gynecology clinic...
Facing this declining streetscape, dirty but loud signs, my mood can only become more reverent.
Because New York is synonymous with diversity; because people can live just to stay alive; because they're not wrong: everything the West sees when looking East is crowded, noisy, and poor!

### (V)
Tour boats linger on the Chicago River, with Lake Michigan lying quietly to the east, while the Windy City's high-rise buildings stand attendant on both sides. Famous for trading bulk commodities and futures, this second-largest financial center in America, this core city of the Midwest, hosted the World's Fair at the end of the 19th century. Numerous newly built stone (rather than traditional wooden) neoclassical buildings earned it the reputation of "White City." A century later, they still stand in the city center, complementing glass towers, each showing their strengths.
Chicago's streets are so wide they make you doubt whether it truly has a long history. This doubt isn't wrong—Chicago indeed underwent a restart like the Ship of Theseus, which was the great fire that burned down the entire city 22 years before the World's Fair. The cause of the fire is disputed, with the most widespread story being that an Irish immigrant's cow kicked over an oil lamp near a haystack—given your understanding of this civilization, you can of course completely deduce the historical fact that in 19th-century America, Irish immigrants were unwelcome ("Help wanted, no Irish need apply").
Regardless, the second Chicago was quickly built. With the growing population, the city's sewage became a bigger problem: since locals drew water from Lake Michigan, they certainly couldn't dump waste into the same lake. Through creative planning, they dug a **sanitary** canal to solve the problem: draining the city's filth southwest into the Mississippi River system, eventually flowing to the Gulf of Mexico thousands of miles away. This canal was considered an engineering feat, but from an urban governance perspective, it was nothing new—downstream cities, though greatly displeased and even taking the matter to the federal Supreme Court, handled their own waste in the same way.
Connecting this to how this country's government guides citizens to view COVID and climate issues, one must say the ancestral narrative template really works every time.
But how many Mississippi Rivers are there in the world?

### (VI)
More than a decade ago, when Apple shocked the emerging smartphone world with the iPhone's thunderbolt, the panicked Google rallied over eighty manufacturers from the mobile phone and communications industry's upstream and downstream suppliers to form an alliance called the "**Open** Handset Alliance." Here, "open" has both broad and narrow meanings: non-Apple is open, Android-based is open.
To this day, you can still find its official website. The prominent manifesto on the site has noble intentions and beautiful visions: staying open, reducing costs, benefiting the mobile industry... until Android gained a foothold, then Google no longer needed it (the website's latest information stops at 2011, when Android's market share first surpassed iOS; the website page still cannot auto-adjust width with browsers).
Obviously, Google's rhetoric grasped something essential: when Westerners hear something described as closed or opaque, they all furrow their brows as if their lifeline has been grabbed.
I call this the G-spot of narrative. At this point, pragmatic people will have huge reactions to abstract concepts; profound thoughts will collapse into black-and-white support or resistance.
While people have finally become alert to the flood of Western ideological vocabulary, few question another more lifestyle-oriented narrative that accompanies these rhetorics: the American Dream—that one can achieve happiness through hard work and struggle. Because the flaw in this narrative isn't in its logic inverting black and white or substituting concepts, but in its **way of seeing**.
The righteousness of the American Dream lies in its seemingly absolute openness—anyone with possibilities won't be excluded. But the American Dream's perspective is individualized: it **never looks beyond the protagonist**.
Chicago's phoenix-like rebirth is such a narrative. The World's Fair held 22 years after the great fire, the sanitary canal dug to improve citizens' living standards—this is a flawless miracle, if you exclude the Mississippi River.
But what lies outside the frame? A person's responsibility to others is absent from the American Dream. The American Dream's establishment must rely on closed personal narratives, must enjoy freedom without costs.

### (VII)
Masayoshi Son once proposed a "time machine" theory—that a multinational company could treat developing countries as developed countries from several years ago, designing business logic and growing along previously practiced corporate development trajectories as these countries develop.
The logic behind this idea is that despite huge differences between countries, their social development will still unfold following similar patterns. From this perspective, capitalist society has **prophetic** qualities.
America's infrastructure problems have consistently been seized upon by Chinese media from a livelihood perspective, though America was previously the most aggressive country in infrastructure development. According to this theory, China's infrastructure will sooner or later face perhaps more widespread and serious aging (because our modernization speed is so fast and coverage so broad)—at least obsolescence, because their designed service lives are all over half a century.
I don't particularly care how these "post-modernization" problems will ultimately be solved from an engineering perspective; I'm concerned with how we will be **psychologically prepared** for this.
Trumps all believe America's world-dominating state is normal; Japan's bubble generation criticizes their young people for being weak, their policies insufficiently tough.
Yes, we know their prejudices are based on outdated realities, but we also have things we believe in wholeheartedly "once we accept certain settings": high-speed trains, gleaming buildings, and China as the world's engine...
A generation born in explosive times will always feel unfamiliar with long periods of cold silence. But **wear** is, after all, the entirety of the second law of thermodynamics.
I think even after unprecedented changes in a century, some things cannot possibly become better than they are now—I mean a narrative approach based on "hope."

### (VIII)
Great entrepreneurs and legendary revolutionaries excel at two things: first, making people believe in and follow their grand but distant ideals; second, remaining clear-headed within these crazy ideals and formulating strategies extremely aligned with actual conditions. One of the driving factors behind China's national fortune, in my view, is precisely that this country is mostly led by such people most of the time.
Starting from reality while still implementing the power of belief, integrating both the idealistic colors of communism and the not-optimistic conditions of New China into unified theory, the program of socialism with Chinese characteristics is, in my view, truly a brilliant conception (while "pro-Soviet" sentiment is a dangerous **romanticization** attempt, trying to use the nobility of the Soviet people to cover the rigidity and lameness inherent in their radical modernization attempts).
In my view, China's own narratives can be divided into three layers according to the length of their visions:
The first layer concerns completing the great rejuvenation (the resolution of the Sixth Plenum states that we are closer to the goal of great rejuvenation than at any time in history). This narrative can be quantified in reference systems: New China's development is a story about self-reliance and catching up with the strong.
The second layer concerns realizing socialism with Chinese characteristics. This narrative aims for common prosperity, quantified through five elements: prosperity, democracy, civilization, harmony, and beauty.
The third layer concerns building a community of shared future for mankind. This narrative is the ultimate goal of communism.
Leaders have long thought clearly about these matters. But the integration and tension between ideals and reality ultimately concerns survival.
In discussions about modernization, we have already been saved once by "black cat, white cat." What worries me is that, as Taleb proposed in "Antifragile," the source of resilience is diversity and flexibility—under highly similar value systems, do we have the ability to flexibly adapt again in the face of unknowable challenges?

### (IX) Some Random Thoughts

#### 1.0
Broadly speaking, capitalism is not merely an ideology but a class of self-reinforcing processes where things greedily pursue proliferation.
In this sense, obsession with big data is a form of capitalism. Obsession with connection is a form of capitalism. Therefore, the metaverse is also thoroughly capitalism.

#### 2.0
The value of virtuality to people lies in enabling them to switch between different personas. Therefore, true online social interaction should rupture rather than integrate with existing social methods. Tool-based, fragmented virtual social methods are the real need.
Unfortunately, social networking companies that measure by stickiness, engagement (and more high-sounding reasons like security) can only create products that are extensions of real personas.
That is, people end up needing to manage multiple extremely similar persona profiles both online and offline, participating in higher-saturation social interaction, losing solitary behavior, completely becoming nodes transmitting information on connection networks.
So even the broadest form of capitalism leads to human alienation, because this society's development doesn't try to make people happier, but makes people more clueless.

#### 3.0
Why do people always fantasize that gods are compassionate? Because compassion is such a kind of indulgent rationality that makes even gods who establish order need to handle problems (or choose not to handle problems) according to human emotional laws.

#### 4.0
How to become someone else's guardian angel 101: Don't say "I told you so / If you had followed what I said, you wouldn't have..." when they stumble.
How to become middle-aged: Unable to restrain yourself from correcting others.

#### 5.0
Two ways to maintain peace of mind: the weariness of having seen autumn moons and spring winds, and the indifference that comes from recognizing others are unrelated to oneself.

（序）

自十二年前某个正视创口的夏夜开始，每年一次，我总会保持这样的表达欲望，用以记录过去一年的思考变化。

〇九年，EVA新剧场版“破”发布，其被奉为经典的插曲《翼をください》一直伴随我写完之前的十二篇文字。同样源自这些往事的还有它们令人不知所然的标题《嘘之默然》。

然后今年，以告别为主题上演的最后的终章为这个我曾深信不疑的神话体系划上休止；本着对这自少年开始的一厢情愿的姻缘的负责任态度，我也决定为从此往后的总结换个名字。

从表达主观感受（主要是自怜），到嚷嚷些自以为独此一家的观念，到对趋势的片面和声明式的概括，再到开始对具体事件的记录和反思；顺着文字一路看来，这些埋点正好反映出一个青年逐渐从内向外“看见”，在更能娴熟对付和应用自己感情的同时，将视角转向理解世界之复杂，无情和纠缠的过程。

而如果没有这些记录，不久后我也许会对那个标榜孤独、拒绝和解、凝视自身所被赋予的敏感，只专注内心体验的少年感到诧异——因为这毕竟与你大相径庭！因为如今你被平凡淹没，努力保持客观，并对真相拥有适可而止的好奇——尽管这种好奇的底色也许是悲伤和无能为力的。

但是真诚并不因之改变。你从不对自己撒谎。哪怕隐没人群，你也依然会为了创造些什么微不足道的东西而做出努力。

你知道哪怕最为公正的历史也是一种叙事，而你的生活——正如斯特兰德诗中所说——就是你生活的故事。


不可能说出天气
将以什么形式出现。
我们朝双手呵气，
试图使它们保持温暖。



（一）

包括摄影在内的众多艺术形式都在二十世纪经历了一个“由外及内，由过程到片段，由叙事到抒情，由克制激情到刺激感官”的发展过程。这个过程，从好的方面说，解放了原初艺术中客观框架的束缚，让主观感受和情绪表达成为一件并不羞耻（或值得宣扬）的事情，使得人的审美变得多元和开放。就趋势而言，艺术的动机总体上是在变得越来越私人化的；艺术的目的性不再明确，艺术的评判标准变得模糊了。

而在这其中，摄影与众不同。与巨幅油画和小型装饰画、大型交响乐和小型室内乐这种可以明显让观者感受创作成本差距的艺术形式相反，照片和照片之间几乎是平等的。尤其是，得益于便携式拍摄设备的大范围普及，按下快门的瞬时生产过程，以及无处不在的数字化的观看方式，摄影无论从生产还是消费层面都是门槛最低的艺术媒介。

大众化的倾向自然使得摄影市场里门派林立，或说鱼龙混杂；而尽管尊重多元，我依然坚持自身的鉴赏力，并怀疑群体风尚的盲目惯性。就是说，在这个私人叙事的重要性被抬举到不必要高度的当下，我始终认为艺术（包括摄影）必须做到内容大于形式，实质大于风格。

摄影中的私人叙事体现在一下两种风潮之中：第一是单调滤镜的打卡照片中对主体的过度强调和修饰；第二是常见于所谓艺术摄影的作品中通过堆叠抽象色彩达到对情绪的隐喻。两种叙事带有不同的个人特质（前者如在聚光灯下跳舞，后者如在朗诵会上读诗）。而尽管并不是所有的私人叙述都绝望地渴求关注，两种叙事的内核仍然相通，都是自恋的体现。

自恋是时代的风潮。尽管我也说不清究竟是这个时代更加自恋了，还是因为人人都能成为媒体，所以我们听见更多自恋的声音。

这同时也是一个浮躁的时代。我们把视频倍速播放，到头来还是什么都没记住什么都没看懂。

而自恋加浮躁，这当然是作为艺术的摄影的最好时代。



（二）

但摄影作为一种技术手段（以感光元件记录外部瞬间），本身是非艺术的。我将这种与艺术的平行关系当做我的摄影哲学。

摄影的特殊性在于，如不是刻意摆布场景，其取材则完全源自现实本身。拍摄者并不构建场景，而是在截取场景——从时间和空间两方面。

一张照片可以被看做一个独立的实体，它既无法展示拍摄前后（时间）被拍摄物的变化，也无法表现景框之外（空间）的任何事件。但这种对瞬间的凝固并未禁止观看者运用逻辑和常识，反向构建出时间和空间上的可能性——这即是摄影隐喻性的体现。

的确，底材的客观限制了拍摄者的创作（我无法在大中午拍下一栋楼房，却想表现它在夜晚的模样），但反过来说，这种纪实的真实感则是摄影媒介独有的特性。也就是说，摄影记录和展示的，应当是**生活本身**。

美国街头摄影师维诺格兰德曾说，他拍照是为了“看看事物被拍摄下来的样子”。这句话可以有多重解读，但从任何角度看，“事物被拍摄下来的样子”都是区别于当代主流摄影语言中“拍摄者眼中事物的样子”的。

建立正确的审美需要理解美的历史脉络而并非凭借时下的风潮，但这并非易事。正如很多人以流行音乐为音乐，商业和风光摄影的镜头语言也常被误解为摄影的一切：以形式美为先导，照片应该记录事物最为理想（而非最为典型或真实）的样子。依次类推，当人们希望为自己的自恋找到足够的依据时，他们当然希望运用摄影，在相片中完成他们对生活的**超越**。

好的照片遵循现实的秩序、必然还有传奇性。坏的照片则完全依赖“众所周知照片无法作假”的逻辑成立。

一座真正的埃菲尔铁塔就应该他妈有一副在巴黎而不是拉斯维加斯的样子。而在铁塔旁的塞纳河边路过的人都知道，被风扬起和吹走的，是遍地的尘土而不是告白气球。



（三）

一个人的相册就是一个人的自恋指数计。
不懂得拍照不是问题，太懂得展示自己则是一个大问题。
不要自恋，一切都好说。而要改正自恋，首先要从拒绝肤浅的情绪和空洞的精致开始。



（四）

这里有足够一个人活下去所需的一切，也许更多——只要你降低期待！在我所路过的所有曼哈顿的拥堵街道中，没什么地方比中国城（或用官方的说法，华埠）的东百脑汇街更纽约或更不纽约的了。

这里，自曼哈顿驶向皇后区的高架上，BDNQ四条地铁沉重地自头顶越过，除了难以忍受的噪声外，偶尔还能从轨间带来局部的不明降水。

虽然被这大桥限制了高度，顽强生长的怡东商场依然在庇佑着众多的杂货铺：卖手机卡的，卖燕窝的，婚介所，还有它的亲女儿：五星餐厅怡东大酒楼。但这个酒楼的牌匾下面却是另外两家珠宝行和一家饼屋。

街角的棚子边贩卖水果的女子正在摩挲了一饼塑料袋。摊位上的热带水果在秋天的冷风里耷拉着，但并没有减价销售。虽然没有任何标识，在华裔聚集的地方，现金永远是最优先级的支付方式。

紧邻十字路口的的地方，有一个打着中美包裹来回接送牌子的更小的铺子，店前却堆着各种小食品，香烟，以及包装可疑的口罩。里面的大爷受面前的柜台和身后的墙壁所限，只能做横向和转身运动，但也因此练就了一身绝活：在车水马龙的交叉口如雕像般静止地消磨生活。

往西行，道路更加局促。但表面的黯淡不能说明什么：东方文化总是习惯深藏不露，因此这是块藏龙卧虎的宝地。知音摄影公司用一张巨大的婚纱照挡住居民楼的消防梯，而旁边的五层洋楼里，从上到下分别是东方艺术培训中心、中国社会民主党办公楼、报税和保险、以及皮屑和妇科疾病诊疗室……

面对这衰颓的街景，脏污但洪亮的招牌，我的心情只能越发虔敬。

因为纽约是多样性的代名；因为人可以仅仅为了活着而活下去；因为他们并没有错：西方看向东方的一切都是拥挤、吵闹与贫穷！



（五）

游船流连于芝加哥河面，视线东面静静躺卧着密歇根湖，风城的高层建筑群环侍左右。以交易大宗商品和期货著名的美国第二大金融中心，这个中部的核心城市曾于19世纪末举办世博会，众多新建的石砌（而非传统木质结构）的新古典主义建筑为其赢得“白城”的美誉；时隔百年，它们依然在林立于市中心，和玻璃大厦们交相辉映，各展所长。

芝加哥的街道宽阔得令人怀疑它是否当真有悠久的历史。这种怀疑并没有错，芝加哥确实如忒休斯之船般历经重启，那正是世博会前22年焚毁整个城市的大火。起火的原因众说纷纭，流传最广的说法是某个爱尔兰移民的奶牛踢翻了干草堆旁的油灯——凭借对这个文明的了解，你当然已经完全推测出，在19世纪的美国，爱尔兰移民并不受人待见（help wanted, no Irish need apply）的史实。

无论如何，第二芝加哥市很快就被建了起来。伴随增长的人口，城市产生的污水成了一个更大问题：当地人既然从密歇根湖里汲取水源，当然就不能往同一泊湖里倾倒排泄物。经过富有创造性的规划，他们开凿了一条**卫生**运河解决问题：将城市的污秽向西南排进密西西比水系，并最终流往千里之外的墨西哥湾。这条运河在工程学上被视为一次壮举，但从城市治理角度则毫无新意——下游的城市尽管对此大为不爽并一度闹到联邦最高法庭，他们毕竟是以同样的方式处理自家的污物的。

联系这个国家的政府引导民众看待新冠和气候问题的方式，不得不说祖传的叙事模板真是百试不爽。

只是，世界上又有多少条密西西比河呢？



（六）

十多年前，苹果凭借iPhone的惊雷震撼刚刚兴起的智能手机界的时候，惊恐的谷歌纠集八十于众手机和通讯行业的上下游厂商，组成了一个叫“**开放**手机联盟（Open Handset Alliance）”阵营。这里的开放有广义和狭义两个意思：非苹果的就是开放的，基于安卓的就是开放的。

直到今天，你仍然可以找到它的官方网站。网站上的醒目宣言立意高尚、愿景美好：保持开放，降低成本，造福移动行业……直到安卓站稳脚跟，然后谷歌就不再需要它（网站的最新信息停留在2011年，其年安卓的市场占有率首次超越iOS；而网站页面尚不能随着浏览器自适应调整宽度）。

显然，谷歌的这套话语抓住了某种本质：当一个西方人听到某样东西封闭、不透明的时候，他们都会皱起眉头，仿佛被攥住了命根子。

我把这称之为叙事的G点。在这个点位上，务实的人也会对抽象的概念产生巨大反应；深刻的思想也会坍缩为非黑即白的拥护或抵触。

而虽然人们终于对于泛滥的西方意识形态语汇保持警觉，却鲜有人质疑与这些话术相生相伴的另一个更加生活化的叙事：美国梦，即一个人通过努力奋斗而达成幸福。因为这套叙事的漏洞并不在其逻辑颠倒黑白或偷换概念，而在其**观看方式**。

美国梦的正义性在于其表面绝对开放，只要是拥有可能性的人都不会被排除在外。但美国梦的视角却是个人化的：它**从不看向主角之外**。

芝加哥城涅槃就是这样一种叙事。大火后的22年即开办的世博会，为提升城市居民生活水平而开凿的卫生运河——这是一个无瑕无垢的奇迹，如果排除密西西比河。

但边框之外是什么？一个人为他人所负的责任在美国梦中是缺席的。美国梦的成立必须依赖闭塞的私人叙事，必须享有没有代价的自由。



（七）

孙正义曾提出过一个“时光机器”理论，即一家跨国公司可以把发展中国家当成若干年前的发达国家来设计其业务逻辑，并沿着之前实践过的企业发展脉络随着这个国家的发展而成长。

这个说法背后的逻辑是，尽管国家和国家之间有巨大差异，其社会发展仍将遵循相似的模式展开。从这个角度来说，资本主义社会是具有**预言性**的。

美国的基础设施问题一直被中国媒体从民生角度抓住不放，尽管美国在此以前也是基建最为激进的国家。按照这个理论，中国的基础设施迟早会面临也许更广泛和严重的老化（因为我们的现代化速度是如此之快，而覆盖面又是如此之广）——至少是过时，因为它们的设计使用年限都是半个世纪往上。

我并不如何在意这些“后现代化”的问题最终怎样得到工程学上的解决，我关心的是，我们将如何对此做好**心理准备**？

特朗普们都认为美国天下无敌的状态才正常；日本的泡沫世代批评他们的年轻人软弱，他们的政策不够强硬。

是的，我们知道他们的偏见是基于过时的现实，但我们也有“一旦接受了某种设定“就深信不疑的东西啊：飞速的高铁，锃亮的楼宇，以及中国是世界的引擎……

生于爆发年代中的一代总会对漫长的冷寂感到陌生。但**磨损**毕竟是热力学第二定律的全部。

我想，即使在百年未有之大变局后，也有些东西不可能变得比如今更好了——我是说一种基于“希望”的叙事方式。



（八）

伟大的企业家和传奇的革命者都擅长两件事：一是让人们相信和追随其宏大而渺茫的理想；二是在这种疯狂的理想之中依然保持清醒，制定极度贴合现实情况的策略。中国之国运的内驱因素之一，在我看来，正是这个国家大部分时候都接受着这类人的领导。

从现实出发并依然贯彻相信的力量，将共产主义的理想色彩和并不乐观的新中国国情同时融合进统一的理论之中，中国特色的社会主义纲领在我看来，实为天才的构想（而“精苏”情绪，则是一种危险的**浪漫化**尝试，试图用苏联人民的崇高遮盖住其激进现代化尝试中本身的刻板和跛脚之处）。

在我看来，中国自己的叙事依照愿景长短可以分为三层：

第一层是关于完成伟大复兴（六中全会的决议中写道，我们比历史上任何时期都更接近伟大复兴的目标），这种叙事可以在参照系中量化：新中国的发展是个有关自力更生，追赶强者的故事。

第二层是关于实现中国特色的社会主义，这种叙事以共同富裕为目标，通过富强、民主、文明、和谐、美丽五个要素进行量化。

第三层是关于构建人类命运共同体，这个叙事是共产主义的最终目标。

领导者们对这些事情早就想得挺明白了 。但理想和现实的融合拉扯，毕竟事关存亡。

在关于现代化的讨论中，我们已经被“黑猫白猫”拯救了一次。而我感到隐忧的是，正如塔勒布提出的“反脆弱”中，韧性的来源是多样性和灵活性——在高度相似的价值体系下，我们有能力再一次在不可知的挑战面前灵活应变吗？



（九）一些小思

1.0
广义来看，资本主义并不仅是一种意识形态，而是一类事物贪图增殖的自我强化的过程。
从这个意义说，对大数据的迷恋是一种资本主义。对连结的迷恋是一种资本主义。因此元宇宙也是彻头彻尾的资本主义。

虚拟对人的价值在于可以使人在不同的人格间切换。因此，真正的线上社交应该对已有社交方式的割裂而不是融合。工具化、片段化的虚拟社交方式才是真正的需求。
不幸的是，以粘合度、参与度（还有更为堂而皇之的理由，安全）为衡量标准的社交网络公司做出的产品只会是真实人格的延伸。
也就是说，最后人们需要在线上和线下都同时管理多个极度相似的人格档案，参与饱和度更高的社交，丧失独处行为，完全成为连结网络上传递信息的节点。
所以哪怕最广义的资本主义也会导致人的异化，因为这个社会的发展并非是试图让人更幸福，而是让人变得更没有头绪。
