### Preface
The brief sojourn of merely one month filled my Japanese life so completely that scarcely any space remained for contemplation. Thus, I could only borrow this interlude after the journey's end—or rather, this "transition" between two modes of living—to organize the thoughts I had hastily jotted down into some semblance of coherent consciousness. This month's experience not only fulfilled a childhood yearning but also imbued the word "Japan" with entirely new meaning for me: it first represented the cities I had traversed and measured with my own steps; secondly, it embodied the remnants of fantasies in my heart; and finally, it signified my presence within it—that is, my very existence.
The title I have given this journal reflects precisely the meaning of "katamichi" in Japanese. That is to say, this journey precipitated some irreversible change—not merely the vanished time to which I can never return, but also the trajectory of my existence itself, drawn forth by this voyage.
Completely different from two-dimensional imaginings, this time I faced a real Japan—filled with reality, wrapped in reality, shaped by reality, and utterly real. And I existed within it, not as a concept or as a mere spiritual observer, but occupying actual three-dimensional space with my full bodily presence—which is to say, I participated in the creation of this world.

### 1.0 Kinkaku-ji and Ginkaku-ji
I awoke from my afternoon nap to discover I was merely two stops away from Kinkaku-ji.
The best purification ritual I could manage at that moment was to pull out my phone and access excerpts I had saved two years prior.
*The Temple of the Golden Pavilion*. That was my first encounter with Mishima. From that moment, I was assimilated by the dark crimson substance contained within those words. Unlike other writers, Mishima's works did not focus on reflecting the spirit of an era through its background—rather, he projected his own spirit within the times in which those stories unfolded.
—And Kinkaku-ji, with the absolute brilliance of its gold leaf, reigns over this world. Its magnificent robes are utterly incompatible with the surrounding natural scenery.
"I will not blend in with you."
It is itself an arrogant declaration. Thus beauty reveals its origins—rigorous uniqueness, and the purity and rejection derived from this irreproducibility.
Therefore, beauty is despair. Beauty yearns for destruction. Beauty is the harbinger of ruins.
"What Kashiwagi said might be true—that what changes the world is not action, but recognition."
It should have been so. But at Kinkaku-ji, I comprehended nothing beyond the sweltering heat brought by the clamorous crowds.
Which is to say, this was a terrible pilgrimage.
Yet those things, I unexpectedly grasped at Ginkaku-ji.

It was in the morning's fervent sunlight, walking hungry along the verdant Philosopher's Path, then ascending the mountain-built approach, when I suddenly entered a tranquil garden.
The hour was still early, so only scattered tourists were present. A monk was taking a rake to the gravel beach, furrowing neat rows in the stone.
I walked the winding path through the garden and stood on a small bridge, meaninglessly gazing at the massive carp swimming slowly in the water.
The dense, delicate leaves of those small maple trees were reflected minutely in the water—like blood vessels, or lung tissues—and beyond the branches were vast, leisurely, full clouds and the blue sky filling the entire background.
But it was not merely this. Through those seemingly symmetrical reflections—as if created to backup this entire world with photographic realism—you could still clearly see all the scenery at the pond's bottom. For instance, the pondweed, or the nearly motionless carp, or the vacant, level pond floor.
Then you try extending your head over the bridge's edge, and naturally you see your own image sinking into the water as well—and this metaphor-laden duality is thus complete.

That was a world of the other shore that existed dependent upon this shore. And your own existence was itself a contradiction: you were both an observer of this shore and a participant in the formation of the entire world on the other shore; that is to say, you were watching yourself participate in the world—or rather, you were being watched by yourself.
And what kind of world was that? The moss-covered rocks by the pond's edge seemed to form the frontier of a barrier, as if thereby maintaining the enormous tension of this entire pond—that Dirac sea-like capacity to embrace all things... Yet these ethereal images were ultimately only phantoms floating on the water's surface, and what emanated through this transparent medium with its serene, dark luster was only the eternally unchanging pond bottom. Thus, the overlapping reflections unfolding in this small pond belonged to two different worlds. And the one in which we exist is undoubtedly the more fragile—requiring only a ripple, a fish's tail-swish, and all things would be affected without exception. Which is to say, it does not exist here without foundation—it propagates through a medium.
And have you ever considered that this medium is the vast void that exists like a law? Therefore, the fundamental reason for the world's chaotic emergence lies in this—the world itself is a passage.


But how could this shore's momentary nature not also bring the illusion of permanence?
The pure sky above the maple trees, the rustling sound of wind through green leaves mingling with cicada songs... In such moments, I wanted to find a patch of shallow grass and lie down gently. Here was a powerful magnetic field that dissolved desire; when you looked around, everything enveloping you had stood quietly here for thousands of years and was destined to stand here for thousands more... The sun's rising and setting, the alternation of seasons—here these were but momentary things. It was like the cross-section of annual rings exposed on a felled tree: this vibrant cross-section still bore fresh, tender hues—but growth had ceased, forever maintaining the appearance of the moment it was cut.
Which is to say, this moment leads directly to eternity.

But could not this shore's momentary eternity also drive one to madness?
The pure sky above the maple trees, the rustling sound of wind through green leaves mingling with cicada songs... In such moments, I suddenly wanted to set fire to this entire garden. Here was a powerful curse that made one lose their soul; when you looked around, everything enveloping you had stood quietly here for thousands of years and was destined to stand here for thousands more... The sun's rising and setting, the alternation of seasons—here these were merely cycles repeating without change. Like the Dead Sea Scrolls, it precisely reproduced all prophecies in every moment—thus I became unable to bear it, wanting to escape this cycle. And the method of this escape was to utterly destroy this illusion of eternal life.
This is what we call Siberian hysteria, my friend. Humans always long for eternity while fearing it.

I have previously argued that beauty's uniqueness is the origin of purity and rejection. Eternity and uniqueness share the same source. Thus beauty's extension is clarity and brutality.
Clarity means sharpness, cutting, non-compromise, and all tendencies that refuse homogenization. Brutality is our fragile lives' pursuit of and revenge upon eternity. This is precisely what *The Temple of the Golden Pavilion* meant when it said: "On one hand, humanity's easily destructible form conjures fantasies of immortality, while Kinkaku-ji's solid beauty reveals the possibility of destruction. Things capable of death like humans cannot be eradicated, while imperishable things like Kinkaku-ji can be eliminated."
"The reason we suddenly become brutal is in such an instant: a bright spring afternoon, on carefully manicured lawn, gazing vacantly at sunlight playing through gaps in the leaves."


### 2.0 Roppongi
This was my first time seeing such a city.
When I looked out from the helicopter platform atop a Roppongi skyscraper, densely packed buildings filled all the ground space in my field of vision to the horizon. Occasionally high-rises clustered together, or transmission towers stood alone, like neural synapses for signal transmission, displaying some kind of regional aggregation phenomenon. As the fiery red sunset gradually faded, the entire city did not sink into slumber as expected, but through illumination and decorative lighting, showed excellent adaptation to darkness; in this stark contrast, it exhibited a kind of surging vitality even more apparent than in daylight.

This was my first time discovering cities could take such form.
When I rode the train around the Yamanote Line, from Shibuya to Shinjuku, to Ikebukuro to Ueno to Shimbashi to Shinagawa... every stop showed nothing but surging crowds and towering buildings, displaying extremely similar modernization.
The city where I was born and raised has very obvious growth rings—from the First Ring Road to the Second Ring to the Third Ring—these are the traces of how this city grew. Those small European towns can be recognized from afar by the towering spires or domes of their churches. That is to say, when you tour your hometown with friends, you can point to that square or that building and say, "Look, that's this city's **center**."
But Tokyo has no center. Or rather, it simultaneously possesses multiple centers. Of course, you could say this city had already taken substantial shape before modernization and never experienced any destructive blow (i.e., reset), thus creating today's chaotic **urban planning**.

But what makes you so confident that all this results from consequences of **human** planning? Put another way, isn't it possible that Tokyo as a city, as some kind of living organism, chose to **evolve** into this current form without a central nervous system?
What does this mode of aggregation signify? If you could ask that blonde genius girl who battles Angels, she would probably frown and say with a "tch," "This is really troublesome—**this thing** actually has multiple cores."
Which is to say, without simultaneously destroying all cores in one strike, this thing could still self-repair.
The key is, Tokyo is still far from its complete form. This city annually absorbs tens of thousands of young people's existence and aspirations like a hurricane's eye, indiscriminately—don't you feel this blood transfusion-like method of absorbing nutrients shares the same evolutionary strategy as those tropical carnivorous plants that dress themselves beautifully to hunt insects? —And Tokyo, in our eyes, is indeed full of charm.
Have you ever considered that super-cities like Tokyo, which transcend human definitions of cities, have development directions that have long escaped human control and no longer belong to us; or more frighteningly, if we are not merely its nutrients—more precisely, we are **components of this city's cellular structure**. That is to say, the most **insignificant** parts that can be replaced at any time.

Looking out from Roppongi's observation deck, after nightfall in Tokyo, all the building rooftops have red lights blinking. The meaning is probably this: we have evolved to no longer need sleep.
I couldn't help thinking of those people I saw in the last train cars, bodies carrying the smell of alcohol, collapsed and sleeping everywhere. In their bloated bodies constricted by uniforms, I saw only devastation. Women had become indifferent to their incomplete makeup, while men cared nothing about emanating body odor-filled sweat stench. They had suffocated behind masks all day and were too exhausted to care about anything else, let alone maintain the energy-consuming pretense and etiquette.
It's not only nuclear contamination that distorts people. Nor do all people willingly become distorted. But why does no one speak out against this systematic, collective withering caused by this system?
Probably those who thought of stopping have already vaguely realized that by now, no one can truly stop this machine anymore.
This simultaneously means that Tokyo's existence is **guiding** human development toward some kind of **inevitable conclusion**.

### 3.0 Sun Dogs and Full Moon
On the evening of July 18th, I boarded the Nozomi from Kyoto back to Tokyo. Sunlight gradually lengthened and disappeared in the car, and thus night also rose.
The train passed through the spaces between cities, and the scattered lights leaking from the buildings rushing past on both sides reminded me of the "leaping fishing fires" in Lu Xun's "Social Drama."
Of course, there was another far brighter light source. The ancients' observations were certainly not without reason—that full, round moon stood out against the darkness, truly like a disk suspended in the firmament without any support.
Of course, the ancients did not have today's means to travel a thousand li in a day. Therefore, in their eyes, this round, jade-like full moon obviously symbolized benevolent blessings.
But if you board an express train, this blessed manifestation becomes a kind of unsettling **threat**.
I mean, in the entire empty darkness, only this object is intensely **watching** you. And when you try to meet its gaze, try to discern some meaning from this **stare**, you discover that bright, almost dazzling radiance contains no metaphor or meaning—only vast emptiness. Yet this force does not expand outward, does not rush to illuminate the surrounding dimness, but obediently curls up within that small circular formation. That is to say, this disk undoubtedly possesses some highly destructive **potential energy**—and given its violation of the principle of free diffusion, this restraint indeed demonstrates some kind of **intelligence**.
You follow the train in rapid movement, but this is useless—that fountain of light continuously follows you—no, tracks you, aims at you, and effortlessly maintains **relative stillness** with you. And relative stillness means immovable **gaze**, inevitably accurate **gun barrel**, and inescapable **destiny**.
I imagine the declaration of final judgment might be exactly like this.

Also, on the evening of July 30th, I was flying from Taipei to Singapore via connecting flight.
I had specifically booked a starboard window seat, thinking I could enjoy a magnificent sunset from the plane. But the weather over the Pacific that day was not particularly good—the sun was shrouded by thin cloud layers, making the entire sky appear gray and hazy.
Disappointed, I could only open a movie I had prepared on my computer, then fell asleep during the journey. When I awoke from my brief rest, a hazy halo had somehow grown around the sun.
Of course, I knew this was merely a weather phenomenon called a sun dog. But when I had looked up at it before, this ring was parallel to the ground—but this time the view was vertical, and visually, the ring's lower portion seemed to reach directly to the sea surface. On the symmetrical left and right sides of the ring were two brighter light spots—so-called "phantom suns."
I pressed myself against the window, greedily observing this uncommon sight, trying through careful observation to preserve it in my memory.
Perhaps from staring at the sun too long, I became dizzy—that is to say, I perceived the "symbolism" behind this structure.
Yes, before this, I had experienced a terrifying stare-down with the bright moon; and if the full moon represented the **omen of being locked on**, then the sun dog was the divine **weapon** for divine punishment.

I think Anno Hideaki must have borrowed from this sun dog image when designing Ramiel's attack mode. And I, as a junior, connected the two through reverse reasoning:
The outer ring is the power source and adjustment tool for the entire structure, and through some principle of reflection, superposition, or intersection, focuses its energy to the ring's center—that is, that precise heat source. Similarly, that is also a **gun barrel**. But compared to the full moon, because of that light ring, it appears to have more precision capable of striking vital points.
The world outside the window was a vivid world. It was a vast space constructed of thin atmosphere and equally thin cloud layers, and this massive, clear sun dog totem undoubtedly proclaimed some rule-violating, world-reconstructing, heaven-and-earth-opening primordial power.
So that was a stigmata.

### 4.0 Farewell Forever
By now, whether clouds drifting past the window or high-voltage power lines on fields whistling by, none of it feels fresh anymore. Only out of a photographer's instinctive pursuit do I stare vacantly at those fleeting scenes.
Those scenes merely recreate certain journeys I have continuously experienced. If one ignores the differences in departure points and destinations, this act of "transition"—or passage—becomes some kind of deliberately ritualistic farewell.

When did I begin to grow accustomed to departure?
Each time I step alone into a train car or aircraft cabin, pragmatically stow my luggage, take my assigned seat, I can still sense from surrounding passengers an excitement beyond words; of course, this might be the residual conditioned reflex from years ago, when I was still thrilled by every departure.
This unfamiliar seat holds for me a strange familiarity, or what might be called a sense of "overlap." That is to say, I can still feel the ripples of countless similar scenes spreading through my memory—just as I can recall the different star-filled skies I've seen from airplanes, or the seasides and countryside passed by trains.
And this familiarity makes me feel that this transitional state is actually the normal condition—thus I find peace of mind in the very act of embarking on journeys.
That is to say, the sense of belonging I feel lies not in longing or reminiscence, but in the ambiguous zone between farewell and embrace—which also precisely represents my emotional contradiction between expectation and aversion toward forming bonds with others.

When did I begin to be infatuated with departure?
Wishfully thinking I deserve a better life, or wishfully believing I will transform the hell I'm about to face into heaven... In the end, my indifference toward bygone days has reached such a decisive degree.
Some things, even when I clearly recognize them as "ichigo ichie"—unique experiences irreproducible at any level—I feel no hesitation or reluctance when bidding them farewell.
This is partly because of some persistent obsession with the future, thus not being constrained by past burdens; and partly because I have developed a kind of disappointment and fatigue toward uniqueness itself.
If the world is governed by causality and purely random events, then no matter what form of unique events we miss, they will certainly appear in the future in another guise. Therefore, there are only two measures for uniqueness: first, there is nothing new under the sun; second, every experienced moment is unique. Either statement negates the value of any particular moment as worthy of remembrance for existing as a unique moment.
Before realizing this, I had believed there was something called a "near-field zone"—a shadow area around me. Within this I could obtain some kind of **static relationship**—unchanging streetscapes, identical greeting patterns, seemingly seamless friendships, permanent family bonds. This notion formed precisely because every time I returned home during holidays, I would order the same three liang of plain pepper and mixed sauce noodles with vegetables at the same noodle shop downstairs—and the same bustling customers and shouting and identical taste stimuli created the illusion that at least in certain areas, time had stopped.

However, just this past bitter March, I suddenly learned of my grandmother's death.
I wanted to cry, but this was not a bolt from the blue, but a reasonable, even logical conclusion I stubbornly refused to acknowledge.
When I returned to Chengdu during February's Spring Festival, although her condition was stable, grandmother was already lying weakly in her hospital bed. Even then I spent a long time confirming before I could believe—grandmother, who had still been healthy during last summer's vacation, why had she suddenly become so frail?

Yes, I had clearly glimpsed that fracture in time, yet I still believed that when I next returned home, this fracture would heal and all discord would be reconciled.
But it did not unfold as I expected. Because there was never any time that could pause or reverse. The shells of things are like buildings weathered by wind and frost—their internal decay happens moment by moment, but collapse is instantaneous—this is the **developmental trajectory** of things.
After experiencing other even more lonely and sorrowful things I prefer not to recall, I finally abandoned that already hole-riddled notion of a "near-field zone."
And this realization that suddenly exposed me **completely** to the chaotic rotation of external things first made me **truly feel** the bone-chilling loneliness of my solitary existence and the desperate desolation all around. It was also at this moment that I truly discovered the relief and certain twisted pleasure of having complete control over myself.
No more shadow zones. Except for my own self, the entire world was a thorough, irrelevant to me, clear wilderness. Understanding this principle brought me relief instead—I finally need not be responsible to anyone and could be openly selfish.

I was free. Although the external world imposes many restrictions on me, what produces countermeasures is "I" as an absolutely individual existence with truly independent thought.
Previously, I had seriously agonized over the question of settling down. I thought as a child's obligation, I should care for my parents—yet I harbored more longing for another continent, which made me feel irritated and at a loss. Now? This problem was easily resolved. I would no longer be constrained by so-called filial duty—that is to say, even if I chose to care for them, my starting point would be repayment for their nurturing or kindness, not according to any obligation that must be fulfilled.
Yes, I finally grew accustomed to constant loss. Because I finally realized that apart from the self, there is nothing I can truly possess.
And with the wilderness clear, I must therefore become more cruel.

前言

区区一月的短暂停留让我的日本生活直充实到几乎没有筛出任何可供思考的空隙，于是，我便只有借在这旅行结束之后的间隙、或称两种生活接轨的“过渡”，将当时速记下来的思考好歹整理为一种连贯的意识。而这一个月的体验，不仅完成了我自儿时起的憧憬，也让“日本”这个词对于我有了全然崭新的意义：它首先代表了一个个我丈量而过的城市、其次代表了我心中幻境的遗迹、最后代表着我在其中的行踪，也即我的存在。

我给这篇日志命名的含义，正是“片道”在日语中的本意。这就是说，这次旅行引起了某种不可复原的改变——不仅是我再也无法回去的、业已消逝的时光；同时也是指我的存在本身的行迹，由这旅途牵引了。

和二次元的构想完全不同，这一次我面对的，是一个现实的、被现实所填充的、被现实所包裹的、又由现实塑造的、现实的日本。而我身处其中，并不以概念的形式、或徒具灵体的旁观者，而是在三维的空间中实实在在地占据了等身的体积——这就是说，我参与了这个世界的创造。



1.0 金阁寺、银阁寺

我从午睡中惊醒，才发现距离金阁寺不过两站的距离。
此时我能做到的最好的净身仪式，就是掏出携带电话，访问两年前留下的摘抄。
《金阁寺》。那是我与三岛的第一次接触。也就是自那时起，我被那些文字中蕴藏的暗红色物质同化了。和其他作家不同，三岛的作品并没有着力于透过时代的背景反映时代的精神——他是在那些故事发生的时代中，展现他自己精神的投影。
——而金阁寺，以其金箔上绝对的闪光，君临这个世界。它那袭华美的袍泽，与周围的自然风物格格不入。
“我不会融入你们。”
它本身就是一个傲慢的宣言。由此美便展现了它的根源——严密的一次性、以及由此不可复制性派生的纯粹和拒绝。
因此，美是绝望的。美是向往破坏的。美是废墟的前兆。

“柏木所说的事或许是真的，他说，改变世界的，不是行动而是认识。”
本应是这样。但在金阁，我并没有领悟到除了嘈杂人流带来的燥热之外的其他东西。
也就是说，这是一次糟糕的圣地巡礼。
但那些东西，我却意外地在银阁寺领悟到了。

那是在清晨热烈的阳光中，我饿着肚子走过郁郁葱葱的哲学之路，又踏上依山而建的参道，就突然间就迈入了一个清幽的庭园。
时间尚早，因而也只有三两稀疏的游客。寺里的僧人正拿着犁杖在碎石滩垄出一犁犁工整的沟洫。
我走过蜿蜒穿越庭园的小径，站在小桥上，无意义地眺望水中缓慢游动的庞大鲤鱼。
那些小枫树茂密而精致的树叶细密地倒影在水中；简直就是血管，或者肺叶——而枝杈以外，就是大片大片悠然而饱满的云朵，和填满整个背景的蓝天。
但并不仅是这样。你透过那些仿佛以对称构建的、有如是用来备份这整个世界的逼真倒影——你仍然可以清楚地看见池底的所有景物。比如说荇草、或几乎静止的鲤鱼、或者空旷而平整的池底。
然后你试着将头伸出桥面，当然你就看到自己的影像也沉入了水中——而这个满含喻意的二义性也就完成了。

那是一个依附于此岸而存在的彼岸的世界。而你本身的存在也是一个矛盾：你既是此岸的观察者，又在彼岸参与整个世界的形成；也就是说，你正注视着参与世界的自己——又或者说，你被你自身注视着。
而那又是一个怎样的世界呢？池边的长满青苔的岩石仿佛构成结界的边疆，仿佛借此可以维持整潭池水那包容万物的狄拉克之海般的巨大张力……可是这缥缈的影像终究只是浮在水面的幻影，而透过这种透明介质泛出沉静而黝黑光泽的，只有亘古不变的池底。所以，在这片小小塘池中展开的重影，隶属于两个不同的世界。而我们在其中存在的那个，无疑是更为脆弱的——只需一个涟漪，一次鱼的摆尾，所有事物都会无一例外地受到波及。这就是说，它并不是毫无依凭地存在与此的——它是在介质中传播的。
而你有没有想过，这种介质，就是宛如法则般存在的巨大虚空。因此，世界混沌缘起的根本在于——世界本身就是一条通道。
（而我今早又读起王安石《桂枝香•金陵怀古》中的句子，觉得这上下两阕之间的对比正好体现了倒影和池底那种瞬时与永恒、变与不变之间的重叠关系：
登临送目，正故国晚秋，天气初肃。千里澄江似练，翠峰如簇。征帆去棹残阳里，背西风，酒旗斜矗。彩舟云淡，星河鹭起，画图难足。
念往昔、繁华竞逐，叹门外楼头，悲恨相续。千古凭高对此，漫嗟荣辱。六朝旧事随流水，但寒烟衰草凝绿。至今商女，时时犹唱，《后庭》遗曲。）

可是此岸的瞬时又何尝没有带来永久不变的错觉呢？
枫树上纯净的天空，风拂过绿叶发出的沙沙声响、和着那阵阵蝉鸣……在这种时刻，我就想找一片浅浅的草丛轻轻躺下。这里有着消弭欲念的强大磁场；当你望向四周，包裹你的全部，都在这里静静地伫立了千百年，又注定还要在这里千百年地伫立下去……太阳的东升西落、四季的更替变换，在这里不过是一瞬间的东西。它就像是被砍伐的树枝上暴露的年轮的切片：这生机勃勃的断层还充满了新鲜而娇嫩的色泽——但生长已经停止了，它永远维持着被砍伐瞬间的容貌。
也就是说，这个瞬间是直通永恒的。

可是此岸瞬时的永恒性何尝不会让人丧失心智呢？
枫树上纯净的天空，风拂过绿叶发出的沙沙声响、和着那阵阵蝉鸣……在这种时刻，我突然想一把火烧毁这整片的庭园。这里有让人丢失魂魄的强大咒力；当你望向四周，包裹你的全部，都在这里静静地伫立了千百年，又注定还要在这里千百年地伫立下去……太阳的东升西落、四季的更替变换，在这里不过是一次一次毫无改变的轮回。它就像死海文书一样在每个瞬间准确重现了所有的预知——于是我变得无法忍受、我要逃离这种轮回。而这种脱离的方法，就是将这种永生的幻想破坏殆尽。
这就是我们所说的西伯利亚癔病啊，我的朋友。人总是憧憬永恒而惧怕永恒的。

我以往论述过，美的一次性是纯粹和拒绝的起源。而永恒和一次性同源。因而美之引申，就是明晰和残暴。
明晰的意思，就代表着尖锐、切割、不妥协、以及一切拒绝同质化的倾向。而残暴，则是我等脆弱之生命对永恒的追求和复仇。这正是《金阁寺》中说 “一方面，人类容易毁灭的形象反而浮现出永生的幻想，而金阁坚固的美反而暴露出毁灭的可能性。像人类那样有能力致死的东西是不会根绝的，而像金阁那样不灭的东西却是可以消灭的。”
“我们之所以突然变得残暴，那是在这样一瞬间。即一个明媚春天的下午，在精心修剪过的草坪上，茫然地眺望着从树叶缝隙筛落下来的阳光戏耍的一瞬间。”
【我的少年时期混浊成黎明的灰暗。黑暗的影子的世界是可怕的，但白昼似得轮廓分明的生，也不属于我。】



2.0 六本木

我还是第一次见到这样的城市。
当我从六本木高楼楼顶的直升机平台放眼望去，鳞次栉比的房屋挤满了视野里到地平线的所有地面空间。而间或高楼聚合成丛，或电波塔兀自耸立，仿佛某种信号传递的神经突触，显出某种区域性的聚集现象。当天边的火红的晚霞渐渐失色，整个城市并没有像预想中一样沉沉睡去，而是借由灯光的照明和装饰，显出了对黑暗良好的适应性；而在这种强烈的对比中，甚至较白昼更为昭然地体现出某种涌动的活力。

我还是第一次发现城市居然还有这种型态。
当我从沿山手线乘坐电车环行，从涩谷到新宿，到池袋到上野到新桥到品川……每一个停靠的站点，无非人潮涌动、高楼林立，显出了及其相似的现代化。
我出生和长大的城市，拥有非常明显的年轮——从一环路到二环到三环——这就是这个城市如何成长的留痕。欧洲那些小镇，也可以从远处就早早眺望到教堂高耸的塔楼或穹顶。就是说，当你带着友人环游故乡，你可以指着那片广场或者那栋楼房说，“看、那就是这个城市的**中心**。”
但东京没有中心。或者说，它同时拥有复数个中心。当然，你可以说这个城市在现代化之前已经初具规模，并且没有经历任何毁灭性打击（也就是重启），因此造成了今天这种混乱的**城市规划**。
可是，你究竟凭什么自信认为这一切，都是**人为的**规划造成的后果呢？换种方式说，有没有这种可能，是东京这个城市作为某种生命体，它自己选择**进化**成了如今这种没有中枢的形态。
这种聚合方式究竟意味着什么呢？如果你能去问问那个和使徒作战的金发天才少女，她大概会“切”地皱皱眉头然后告诉你说，“这可真是棘手啊，**这家伙**居然拥有多个核心。”
也就是说，不同时一击摧毁所有核心的话，这家伙就仍然可以自我修复。

关键是，东京离它的完全体还差得远呢。这个城市每年如同飓风风口一样毫不挑剔地吸收数以万计的年轻人的存在和憧憬——你有没有觉得，这种如同输血般的吸收营养的方式，和热带那些把自己打扮得花枝招展而捕猎昆虫的食肉植物，有着同样的进化策略。——而东京，在我们眼里，也的确是充满魅力的。
你有没有想过，像东京这种超越人类对城市定义的超级城市，其本身的发展方向，早已经脱离人类的掌控，并不为我们所有了；或者更为可怕的是，如果我们不仅仅是它的养料的话——更为贴切地说，我们是这个城市**细胞结构的组成**。也就是说，是随时可以替代的、最**无关紧要**的部分。

从六本木的观景平台望去，入夜后东京，所有大厦楼顶都有红灯闪闪烁烁。那意思大概就是说，我们已经进化到不需要睡眠了。
我就没办法不去想那些在终电的车厢中看到的、那些身上带有酒气的四处瘫倒而眠的人，我在他们被制服勒住的臃肿躯体上看到的只有摧残。女人对自己残缺的妆容早已漠然处之，男人则毫不在意地散发着充满体味的汗臭。他们在面具之下窒息了一天，已经累得无暇他顾了，更何况是矜持和礼仪这种需要费劲维持的东西呢。
并不是只有核污染才会让人变得扭曲的。也并不是所有人都意愿被扭曲的。但这种制度所引发的群体化的凋零，为什么没有人为之发声呢？
大概那些想过停止的人已经隐约意识到，事到如今，已经没有人可以真正停下这个机器了。
这同时也就是说，东京的存在，正在**引导**人类的发展朝着某种**必然性结局**推进。



3.0 日晕和满月

7月18日的傍晚，我乘上希望号从京都回往东京。阳光在车厢中逐渐拉长和隐没，于是黑夜也上升了。
列车在一个个城市的中间穿过，而两旁簌簌而过的楼房中漏出的点状灯光，让我想起了鲁迅社戏中“踊跃的渔火”。
当然还有一个远为明亮的光源。古人的说法显然是不无道理的，那轮饱满的圆月兀自凸显在黑暗之上，简直就是一个不依靠任何支撑就悬挂在天穹的圆盘。
当然，古人并没有如今这种手段可以一日千里地飞驰。因此，在他们眼里，这轮圆润的玉石般的满月，显然充满了施降恩惠的福祉的象征。
但如果乘上急行电车的话，这个充满祝福意义的展现，就变成了某种令人坐立不安的**威胁**。

我是说，在整个空无一物的黑暗之中，唯有这个物体在强烈地**注视**着你。而当你尝试与之对视，尝试从这种**目光**中探寻出什么意义的时候，你会发现那明亮到几乎耀眼的光芒毫无暗喻和意义、只是充斥着巨大的虚空——而这种力量却并没有向外膨胀，并没有急于去照亮周围的黯淡，而是规矩地蜷缩在那个小小圆阵之中。也就是说，这个圆盘无疑拥有毁灭性极高的某种**势能**——而且以其对自由扩散原理的违背来看，这种克制确实体现出了某种**智慧**。
你跟着列车做着快速移动，但这并没有什么用处，那个光之泉眼一直追随着你——不，是跟踪着你、瞄准着你，而且不费吹灰之力地和你保持**相对静止**。而相对静止的意思就是，不能移走的**凝视**，必然命中的**枪口**，以及无法逃避的**命运**。
我猜想，末日审判的宣言可能与此别无二致。

又，7月30日的傍晚我正乘飞机从台北转机飞往新加坡。
特地预订了靠右舷窗的座位，我原以为可以在飞机上欣赏壮美的日落。但那天太平洋上的天气不见得怎样的好，太阳那被那些薄薄的云层笼罩，使得整个天空显得灰蒙蒙的。
我惘然若失地只好打开电脑里预备好的电影，又在途中陷入睡眠。而当我再次从小憩中清醒过来，太阳的周围不知何时长出了一转朦胧的光圈。
当然，我知道这只是叫做日晕的天气现象。可是以往仰头看到的时候，这个圆环是平行于地面的——但这一次的景象是垂直的，就视觉效果来说，圆环的下部仿佛直达海面。而在圆环的对称左右两侧，也各有一个更为明亮的光斑，也就是所谓的“幻日”。
我将自己贴上舷窗，贪婪地注视这种并不多见的景象，尝试通过细致的凝视将其保存于脑海。
也许是盯着太阳看的太久的缘故，我产生了眩晕的感觉，就是说，我观测到了这种结构背后的“象征性”。
是的，在此之前，我曾和皎洁的月亮有过一次骇人的对视；而如果说满月代表了被**锁定的预兆**，那么日晕就是施加天罚的“神明的**武器**”。
我想庵野秀明在设计雷天使的攻击模式的时候应该就是借助了日晕这个形象。而我作为后辈，则通过逆推将两者联系到了一起：
外侧圆环是整个结构的动力来源和调整工具，而通过某种法则的反射、叠加或者交叉，将其上的能源**聚焦**到了圆环中心——也就是那个精准的热源。同样，那也是一个**枪口**。但比起满月，因为那圈光环的缘故，显得更加具有可以直击要害的精确性。
舷窗外的世界是一个鲜明的世界。它是由稀薄的大气和同样稀薄的云层构筑的广袤空间，而日晕这个巨大而明晰的图腾无疑宣告了某种违反规则的，足以重构世界、开天辟地的洪荒力量。
所以说，那是一道圣痕。



4.0 后会无期

事到如今，无论是窗外飘过云朵或是田野上的高压电线杆呼啸而过，我都再不会感到新鲜。只是出于摄影爱好者的天生的追逐，而痴痴呆望着那些一闪而过的景色。
那些场景，不过是重现了某些我不断历经过的旅途。如果无视出发点和目的地的不同，这种“转换”或称为过渡的行为，便是某种不得不刻意为之的仪式般的告别。

我是从何时开始习惯于出发的呢？
每次独自踏进车厢或者机舱，我事务性地搁好行李，坐上指定的席位，我仍能从周围乘客的身上感受到一种溢于言表的激动；当然，这也许是多年前，当我还在为每一次离港兴奋不已的条件反射的残留。
这陌生的座位于我却有一种异样的熟稔，又或者称之为“重叠”的感觉。那即是说，我仍能感受到起无数次相似场景在我记忆中漾开的余波，那正是我能回想起的在飞机上看见过的不同情状的星空，或者列车上驶过的海滨和田园一样。
而这种熟稔让我感到这种过渡状态反而才是常态——于是我在这踏上旅途本身这一行为中，找到了心安的感觉。
也就是说，我所感到的归属感并不在于憧憬或者追忆，而是介于告别和拥抱之间的暧昧地带——这也刚好代表了我对与人产生羁绊的期待和厌恶的感情矛盾。

我是从何时开始迷恋于出发的呢？
一厢情愿地认为自己配得上更好的生活，或者又一厢情愿地以为自己要将即将面对的地狱改造为天堂……到头来，我对逝去时日的淡漠竟业已达到了这样干脆的地步。
有些事情，哪怕我清楚地认识到那是“一期一会”这种在任何层面都不可复制的独特体验，我在告别的时候都不会有一丝犹疑或者不舍。
这一方面是因为我对未来某种锲而不舍的执着，因而不会拘泥于过往的拖累；而另一方面则是因为，我对独一无二这种性质产生了某种失望和疲劳。
如果世界是被因果律和纯粹的随机性事件支配的话，那么无论我们错过任何形式的一次性的事件，它都肯定将在未来以另一种面貌出现。因此，衡量独特性的标尺无非只有两把：其一是说，太阳底下并无新事；其二是说，经历的每一个瞬间都是独特的。而无论哪一种说法，都否定了某一瞬间作为独特瞬间的存在而值得铭记的价值。
在我意识到这一点之前，我原以为，我身边有一种叫做“近场区域”的影子地带。在这中间我可以获得某种**静止的关系**——不变的街景、相同的问候方式、看似没有裂痕的友谊、永久的亲情纽带。而这种观念的形成，正是每次放假回家之后，我在楼底的同一家面馆点上同样的三两素椒杂酱面配青菜——而同样熙攘的顾客和吆喝和同样的味觉刺激，让我产生了至少在某些地带，时光是停止的错觉。

然而就在今年苦闷的三月，突然间，我就得知了奶奶过世的消息。
我想哭，可是这并不是晴天霹雳的噩耗，而是合理的、甚至顺理成章的我却死死不肯承认的结局。
在我二月的春节回成都的时候，尽管病情稳定，奶奶就已经衰老地躺在病床上了。那时我也花了很长时间的确认才能相信，明明在上个暑假的时候依然康健的奶奶，为什么会突然间就虚弱下去了呢？
是的，我明明已经好好地瞥见了那个时光的断层，然而我仍然以为在我下次归家之时，这个断层将会复原，而一切龃龉都会和好如初。
然而并没有我所期待的展开。因为本就没有可以停驻和倒溯的时光。事物的外壳亦如历经风霜的建筑——它内部的崩坏是时时刻刻的，但坍塌却只是一瞬的事——这本是事物的**发展轨迹**。
而之后或多或少又经历了其他我所不愿追怀的更为寂寞和悲哀的事情，我才终于放弃了那早已漏洞百出的“近场区域”的想法。

而这种将我突然**完全**暴露在外物混沌的旋转之中的顿悟，第一次让我**真正感到**令人毛骨悚然的自己孑然的存在，以及周遭令人绝望的荒凉。而也就是这个时刻，我才真正发现完全掌控自己之后的轻松和某种扭曲的快意。
再没有影子地带了。除了我自身以外，整个世界就是彻头彻尾的、与我无关的、明晰的荒野。明白这个道理，我反而如释重负——我终于不必为任何人负责、可以明目张胆地自私下去了。
我自由了。尽管外界对我施加了诸多限制，但为此产生对策的，则是“我”作为绝对个体存在的真正独立的思想。
在以前，我曾经认真纠结过定居的问题。我想作为子女的羁绊，我得照料父母——然而我对另一片大陆有着更多的憧憬，这就让我感到烦躁和无所适从。现在呢，这个问题迎刃而解了。我将不再被所谓孝道所拘束，也就是说，即使我选择了照料他们，我的出发点是对养育的回报或者善意，而不是依照任何必须完成的义务。
是的，我终于习惯了不断失去。因为我终于意识到除了自我之外，没有什么东西我能真正拥有。

而荒野明晰，我也因此必须变得更加残忍。
