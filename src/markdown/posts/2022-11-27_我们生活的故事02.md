### (Preface)
The world reaches toward its nadir. In the desert of pandemic, weary travelers joyfully welcome the dawn, until this dawn transforms into blazing daylight. The wreckage and sins scattered everywhere thus reveal themselves in dazzling clarity.
In countless duels over justice, people distinguish friend from foe based on their positions, which has nothing whatsoever to do with whether they engage in thinking. The west wind blows fiercely, yet the chef believes the heat is insufficient, because the most important thing has not yet been completely ignited.
On continents shrouded in faith, people cloaked in morality feel neither hunger nor cold. Across the waters in the lighthouse, PVP enthusiasts compete in their displays of brilliance.
After waves of information floods, exquisite shells transmit the sound of waves that were pre-recorded long ago. These carefully selected artifacts left on the beach seem to have been deliberately placed there by someone before the waves even arrived.
Unknowingly, both the vast cosmos and virtual worlds have become yet another hundred-billion-dollar speculation arena. The bidders are so generous, as if anything would do as long as it's not life here and now.
We have been reminded countless times that we stand at the edge of a cliff, but every seemingly precipitous action only extends this cliff a little further.
This terrifies some while tempting others to seize the opportunity.

### (I)
The Uber driver taking me to the airport skillfully navigated through small alleys to avoid the toll highway, until he reached a congested main road, successfully adding fifteen minutes to the estimated arrival time. He seemed embarrassed by this and attempted to strike up a conversation with me.
He naturally began with soaring gas prices, then launched into a monologue about how being a rideshare driver was such arduous and unprofitable work... until a stylish electric car suddenly cut into the lane beside us, forcing him to brake hard, and this topic was abruptly cut short by what might have been a Spanish curse.
Pointing at the vehicle ahead that had caused him trouble, he asked me, "Do you know why I don't like modern cars?"
"Why?"
"These cars are all electronic systems. They get more and more sophisticated but also more prone to malfunction. I was a mechanic for 20 years, but I can't repair my own car. Every time something goes wrong, the repair bill is fucking expensive. Just like this world."
Just like this world.
The driver was absolutely right. Ever since switching to automatic transmission, both life and automobiles have become increasingly lacking in a sense of control. Much of the time, these increasingly sophisticated and complex systems benefit us greatly; until one day, we receive a jaw-dropping repair bill for damage we didn't cause... We certainly have reason to blame those who make cars less like cars!

### (II)
In the year when Generative AI made its grand entrance into artistic creation, aside from causing another group of people to vaguely worry about their livelihoods being threatened, it hasn't yet created any substantial social impact. That said, this newly torn opening once again reminds us to confront a massive transformation about to permeate every aspect of life—a transformation that might even be subversive at the philosophical level, affecting how humanity evaluates itself.
In an interview, OpenAI's CEO mentioned an unexpected trend in AI development: just 10 years ago, when discussing how artificial intelligence would replace human work, everyone unanimously believed it would start with blue-collar, physical labor requiring no training threshold, then low-end, repetitive white-collar work, and finally creative white-collar work. However, the reality is that AI's development path has been completely opposite—it first reached seemingly extremely complex domains like autonomous driving and artistic creation [1].
This trend appears puzzling on the surface, but if we shift perspectives, it becomes perfectly logical: these emerging application domains are highly digitizable in both input and output. As long as researchers can devise a logically consistent digital pathway, supplemented by sufficient training samples, AI can learn a method to map inputs to outputs. In other words, AI's bottleneck isn't model complexity (especially since algorithms continue evolving), but whether it can obtain enough food.
From this perspective, the inherent difficulty of traditional work isn't the criterion for measuring replaceability—having sufficient initial data accumulation is; and if an industry can maintain enough inertia or barriers to refuse digitization, then perhaps it would be the hardest nut for AI to crack.
But then again, faced with a technology almost destined to bring first-mover advantages, who would dare refuse digitization?

### (III)
My digitization journey began in 2014 when I downloaded Evernote, initially just to conveniently edit and view my organized reading notes across multiple platforms. In 2015, I opened an iCloud account because photos had filled up my phone's storage. In 2019, I saw reports mentioning that even hard drive storage has expiration dates. So I started subscribing to Office 365, finally migrating all remaining personal files from portable hard drives to the cloud (including a first-grade essay titled "A Turtle").
This year, I began seriously considering establishing a more comprehensive personal information collection—to record what I see and hear with finer granularity on a single, or at least limited, platform/application—which of course relates to my profession. Data science often quotes the saying, "You are what you measure," or its alternative version, "If you can't measure something, you can't improve it" [2].
I spent about a month researching and finally settled on Notion, an integrated document application (though its vision extends far beyond this), then spent two weekends migrating all documents and files previously scattered across various platforms.
As a hot application led by Sequoia Capital, its 2.0 version creatively introduced relational database concepts to originally flat document note-taking. Based on this foundation, users can also customize the display methods of this information according to their preferences [3].
In the system Notion constructed, the original core content of documents became merely one part of the "document" concept. Document metadata and document content are given equal weight. Of equal importance are the interaction, combination, and display logic between documents.
That is to say, after breaking down that content-centric fragmentation, documents finally expose that informational characteristic common to all digitized things.

### (IV)
In the era before digital storage and distribution, people had difficulty separating information from its carrier. Music was music, painting was painting, text was text. Until McLuhan proclaimed "the medium is the message," we focused on information's transmission routes. This exaggerated the role of channels, making us blind to the more massive information itself.
This year, text-to-image generative AI applications entered public view, and people marveled at these AIs' "imagination"—this is another example of being deceived by superficial differences. These generative AIs haven't "created" anything; they merely **translate** information obtained from one channel to another channel, while the information carried remains completely unchanged.
In the same vein, what large intelligent recommendation systems do is merely construct two different functions, projecting each customer's preferences and each product's attributes into the same vector space (Embedding). In this space, for machines, customer preferences and product attributes have no essential difference—they're all just information recorded in the same dimension.
Even based on existing encoding methods, I have no doubt that AI's understanding of information is closer to information's true nature than human consciousness. Only at the philosophical or physical level, if we imagine the universe as a massive information flow (entropy), can things reveal their consistency at the informational level after stripping away their myriad forms of existence.
"What we want to do is prove that those individual, particular, uniquely human experiences are merely extremely superficial flickers beneath vast formal systems." While Foucault's words target humanity, don't they equally target all things in this world?

### (V)
In all thinking about "endings," science fiction works are unavoidable peaks. One of my two multi-year plans this year is to systematically read and understand science fiction works.
Unlike the "termination of the future" planned by venture capitalists (reverse thinking is a fashionable term: within ten years, most people will...), fantasy works describe "the unfolding of the future": cutting ties with concrete reality, in a holistic, broader uncertainty, fantasists can more romantically explore or predict everything about human civilization, not just possibilities of technological development.
Just as the differences between agricultural and modern civilizations aren't measured by horizontal expansion or linear complexity, civilizations capable of achieving extraterrestrial colonization must have **philosophical** frameworks fundamentally different from modern society. Concepts like chains of suspicion and dark forests represent thinking conducted on a **cosmic scale** that produces rationality and morality completely independent of contemporary notions.
The most fundamental difference between stories that might occur throughout the universe and stories occurring on Earth is a matter of scale (even traveling at light speed, journeys to neighboring star systems are measured in centuries, and how many technological explosions could occur during that time!). Similar to classical mechanics, all human knowledge constructed so far has an applicable range only at medium scales; exploring things beyond this range could completely reconstruct our understanding of the world.
This isn't solely the responsibility of science fiction writers. This project, though progressing slowly, has already begun. I've always believed that some minds can, through constant refinement, comprehend movement patterns beyond conventional wavelengths: as they age, Munger and Buffett appear increasingly unrestrained, while certain marathon runners bear the faces of ascetics.
"The ultimate in painting (is blindness), seeing things in Allah's darkness [4]." Honestly, I quite like this task.

### (VI)
After enduring lengthy preparation and adjustment [5], the James Webb Space Telescope finally lived up to expectations, transmitting exquisite deep space images. These images are brilliant yet serene, vastly different from the universe itself, filled with immense void and undercurrents. This is actually awe-inspiring—in just an inconspicuous tiny corner of this vast dome, if we carefully dissect it, infinite incomprehensibility is already revealed.
When I see these images, I often think that this instrument composed of precise lenses and cutting-edge technology is no different from those coin-operated telescopes on skyscraper rooftops for tourists. They bring extremely distant landscapes close, satisfying our irrepressible voyeuristic desires.
So far, we've been fortunate enough that within our sight, the universe contains nothing remarkable or noteworthy beyond sparse but omnipresent darkness and breathtaking scenery. But you can completely imagine that someday, these digital signals will truly transmit back some extraordinary images, and then perhaps all of humanity will feel like a pervert who just witnessed something sordid—simultaneously terrified, embarrassed, and satisfied.

### (VII)
Amid turbulent geopolitical environments and lurking stagflation crises, British netizens with ancestral optimism self-mockingly say: everything now resembles 1970s Britain's "British disease," except without the good music [6].
Maybe there is some, but it's not easy to find, because the most popular modern music doesn't serve hearing alone.
Since the concept of multimedia emerged, music has gradually begun depending on scenarios requiring visual engagement, such as nightclubs (electronic dance music) or short videos (brainwashing songs), making them achieve "bundled sales" with information on more efficient channels (visual information accounts for over 70% of all sensory information acquisition by humans), synergistically becoming monsters of viral transmission.
More broadly speaking, "remix"—one of Kevin Kelly's twelve internet trends [7]—also manifests in the fusion between different art forms. Abandoning low-density, single-channel food, remixing brings density growth, and three-dimensional sensory stimulation is naturally more irresistible.
Looking forward from rhythm-intensive dance music and mediocre VR headsets, what comes tomorrow?
It's us, yearning to be filled with information.

### (VIII)
After years of heavy investment, the Japanese anime series introduced by Bilibili finally began to decrease [8]. Out of sentiment, anime fans' dissatisfaction is understandable; but from every perspective, this trend is reasonably difficult to reverse. Fortunately, before China's anime copyright purchasing went downhill, I had already graduated from the two-dimensional world.
This wasn't because I had grown tired of it or due to stereotypical prejudices against anime fans. My "graduation" stemmed from natural detachment—in the current era dominated by moe healing and overpowered protagonist transmigration themes, anime indeed could no longer provide the joy I sought.
It's not just anime; most entertainment content today lacks surprise: formulaic plot development, transparent character personalities. I suspect that if Wilde experienced today's diversions, he would certainly die of boredom.
I've always held this prejudice: different people's hobbies indeed have considerable hierarchical distinctions. Because that ultimately proves what pathways a person uses to obtain pleasure. Therefore, I feel sorry for today's youth—if they don't make efforts to search, the entertainment activities under their noses have almost no nutrition, or they won't attempt to watch/experience in ways that could extract nutrition—this is a mutually interactive cycle between content production and consumption that causes mutual degradation (breaking this cycle means entertainment forms lacking addictive qualities and a less efficient entertainment industry in terms of return on investment—this worldline naturally lacks any appeal).
Hope-based narratives will always be the best narrative method humanity can possess. But even if we abandon hope, there's a huge difference between decadence and wasteful consumption (the energy density contained therein is completely different). What I'm grateful for is that my nostalgia isn't solely due to familiarity with childhood and personal experiences, but because these works truly represent an explosive golden age—they're more enduring than newly published literature in every sense. They expanded human ideals, imagination, and possibilities, even in matters of how to seek death.
Mid-year, an article titled "When the Balance Sheet Doesn't Want to Struggle Anymore" caused quite a stir online [9]. Though I can only glimpse through the keyhole from observing the anime industry, Japan's lost thirty years—the development process of an entire nation from having their spirit twisted to losing spirit entirely—is indeed a profound textbook. This is both lamentable and alarming, especially since Chinese youth have also begun to adopt lying-flat philosophy.
Thus, naturally, such self-appointed pioneers with heavy responsibility emerge to shout: The times call for low-oxygen-demand talent! [10]
Fuck, are you qualified to make such calls?

### (IX)
When an employee proposes new ideas to their boss, they often need to connect company vision and industry trends for macro-narrative. A photographer's inspiration appears in extremely minute, specific moments, requiring keen observation and attention to detail.
I'm often amazed by the different forms things take under these two perspectives.
Life is so complex that when we stand a little further than the experiencers, when we try to summarize a period of history in one or two sentences, when we attempt to "dimensionally reduce" events, we always get a result that smooths individual differences: overall steady progress, generally increasing happiness, tremendous leaps achieved in general—human statistical tools can only reach this level after all.
But human compassion shouldn't float at a thousand meters altitude looking down.

### (X) Three Short Poems

#### I. To Those in Shelters
Before telling me what I should do
Please be sure to complete what you can do
Grand ideals can move me too
But don't rush to preach your methods before finishing your own race
Adapting to any road conditions
Why becoming cautious
A nation has a nation's poetry anthology

#### II. To Those Who Hold the Reins
Don't know which deity thought up this idea
One side creates higher-purity chlorine gas
The other side creates higher-purity metallic sodium
Wait, I'm just here to get some salt
Crows can't help pecking other animals' tails
Who is the crow
A period of history has a period's kitchen debates

#### III. To Sober Trekking
Emotional release is a relaxing surf
Seeking truth is an arduous uphill climb
Parting the mist, your rear has ignorant scoundrels and unknowing saints
(They're not easily distinguished from each other)
Even if the torch doesn't pass by
I try to stay dry
Does this really help
A generation has a generation's Long March

### (XI)
Over the ten-plus years from high school to now, the literature I've encountered has been almost entirely Western and Japanese. Regarding Chinese literature, aside from a few classical novels, I've made no further efforts. This is ultimately shameful and creates intellectual barriers.
In this regard, I am humble. I cannot casually comment on everything happening before entering this cultural context. This would be disrespectful to this nation's profound history and dismissive of my own thinking.
Moreover, as an outsider, I ultimately cannot personally experience these days of continuous dramatic change. In a few years, my days wandering in foreign lands will catch up with the time I've lived in my homeland. For such a wanderer, the motherland will naturally only become more distant and strange. This is saddening but also provides an opportunity to be an observer.
But regardless of how perspectives change, people always want to find belonging in this lifetime. For this body and blood inherited over millennia, I therefore require myself to start reading this Yellow River-like magnificent epic from the beginning. I require myself to systematically and anew understand this yellow earth and the people on this land.
This is an arduous task—let us begin here.

### (XII)
This summer, at Yale's art museum, I saw a photographic work from China. The photo was taken in Long County, Shaanxi, showing three women kneeling on sparse grassland, wearing white clothes and white headscarves, holding wooden sticks wrapped in white paper. They were performing funeral wailing [11].
It looked like a spring morning, with unnatural flash lighting illuminating them. The middle and left figures covered their noses while weeping; the rightmost woman's mouth gaped wide, as if crying out loudly. Their faces showed the blocky mottling common among plateau residents. But being a black-and-white photo, it wasn't clear whether this was from wind-chapping in cold weather or from long labor and sun exposure with poor hygiene. They were sturdily built, like resilient cacti growing on wild soil, able to survive amid widespread hardship with just a little happiness.
I wasn't particularly shocked, but this photograph helped me visualize some rural narratives. In recent novels I've read, ordinary rural Chinese families in modern times first preferred robust build when choosing daughters-in-law. This typically meant the girl could endure hard work, wasn't easily sick, and besides bearing children could work the fields like an adult man. In impoverished times, such choices were supremely economical.
...But this photograph was taken in 2000!

### (XIII)
In "Surging Thirty Years," Wu Xiaobo narrates the massive and tortuous changes in Chinese society since reform and opening from the perspective of commercial transformation (this perspective cunningly yet reasonably avoids many things that cannot be discussed). I emphasize this word—tortuous—meaning unavoidable fluctuations appeared in this economic reform exploration encompassing a billion people. We can understand this rise and fall as temporal imbalance.
Spatial imbalance manifests in differences between reform pilot zones and regions where ideology remains far more entrenched.
I've said before that the "American Dream," through the insularity of personal narrative, ignores the responsibility narrators should bear toward society. In contrast, the "Chinese Dream," through the scaling of macro-narrative, overlooks all differences and fluctuations that always exist in stories. Once recognizing the diversity of Chinese social development across these two dimensions, I must remain vigilant about those singular linear narratives (solely from a PR perspective, I naturally understand the necessity of official "positive filters" to offset the biased "negative filters" in foreign reporting), which is precisely what many zealots excel at.
We often hear representative words that warn but don't completely warn: enduring growing pains, dust of the times... The more sincerely these words are used, the more heartbroken I feel about this disconnection.
Ordinary people's suffering is real, concrete, and bone-deep, but those in shelters cannot feel it. Just as in another ideological narrative, the wealthy who are free from want criticize the poor for lacking diligence and thought.
Having read the novel "The World of Man," what I see is a group of suppressed small people's household-like chatter and dialogue, but progressive thinkers say it "epically displays the magnificent upheaval of Chinese society" [12].
Where does the epic come from? Not everyone buffeted by fate is called Odysseus. Or do you, filled with righteousness and extending yourself to others, think everyone receives fate's protection, lives undamaged days, and naturally should have heroic hearts?

### (XIV)
In more than one novel, I've seen this plot: seasoned officials tell promising juniors whom they place hopes in that once a person decides to become an official, they must "wisely sever intimate relationships with grassroots classes" [13].
We can't say this consideration is completely unreasonable—after all, true ideals are like religion, absolutely cannot have their purity distorted by private desires. This statement is also quite ridiculous because it obviously betrays the ideal's original intention, seemingly suggesting that only when officials actually distance themselves from the masses will their careers proceed smoothly.
Regardless, we have reason to believe this selection method has been passed down, because we hear too much speech that would make any ear with a hint of human feeling suspect they misheard.
We also often hear another set of battle cry contexts: fighting a "tough battle" in five days [14], launching a "blitzkrieg" to block transmission [15], Wuhan's "ten-day major battle" [16], Guiyang's 4 AM nucleic acid testing "racing" against the virus [17]...
Similar to recently mocked internet corporate jargon (not similar in being mocked), these linguistic habits certainly don't arise from nowhere—indeed, they can all be traced to events the organization experienced in its early establishment and methods for resolving these events.
How does this resemble escaping historical cycles?

### (XV)
Path dependence means facing political turmoil and discordant surging public opinion, strong control measures must be adopted.
Path dependence means to maintain equal yet abstract love for the masses, one must distance oneself from them—far enough that their noise can no longer interfere with macro-narrative.
Path dependence means using high-intensity unsustainable mobilization to solve all encountered problems, then praying these problems won't persist long-term.
Path dependence means using martyrs as signposts to demand all believers, glorifying sacrifice and self-damaging dedication, making them feel satisfaction is sinful, like Christians treating the present world as a vale of tears leading to heaven [18].
Path dependence means using opaque assessment systems based on "neither advocating, nor banning, nor promoting" for uncertain events—never taking responsibility, never delegating power, never making mistakes.
Path dependence means consistently using methods that received positive feedback in the past, until many victims appear, until reality proves these methods no longer work.

### (XVI) Some Short Phrases

#### 1.0
"Hidden in dust and smoke" is still too light a phrase. Most of the time, it's either not having time to dodge the sandstorm, or someone hoping sufferers can disappear without a trace, the faster the better.
I think it should be "buried in dust and smoke" to capture the right flavor.

#### 2.0
Some people mock America's China policy of "cooperation, confrontation, competition" as wishful thinking.
These same people demand others sing praises when things improve, stay silent when unclear, and endure when obviously unworkable.

#### 3.0
In the most charitable personification: America is like Gendo Ikari—he has a publicly known righteous plan with hidden calculations; China is like Asuka—she believes saving ignorant people is the elite's mission.
Dealing with either type is quite exhausting.

#### 4.0
Socrates once told Cynics: "Your filth is a kind of vanity" [19]. This tells us people shouldn't think too highly of themselves.
For the same reason, I laughed out loud when rereading Liu Zongyuan's "Preface to Foolish Creek Poems."
Don't befriend people with excessive self-awareness, even if they appear unselfish on the surface.

### (XVII)
Fascination with solitary living permeated my entire adolescence. I could never escape the same question: where do people go? I once sought answers in mysticism and religion but discovered their incompatibility with reality; I once indulged in delicate emotions because beauty's one-time nature rebels against eternity. There seemed to be just these few methods. Regardless of East or West, solutions to this issue have always been thus: you must distance yourself from the mundane world to reach that detached state of forgetting the mundane.
I used to believe there must exist a substitute for the secular world more suited to my temperament—otherwise this deficiency couldn't explain the inevitable chaos and suffering encountered when dwelling in this world. But later I became more peaceful because I read history, connected pearls into lines, began observing changes occurring and about to occur in this second-order chaotic system with a developmental perspective. Then I engaged in work, invested in labor, personally pushed projects forward—this sense of control became increasingly reassuring.
More fundamentally, my work made me identify with dataism, so I would say: interaction is more valuable than isolation.
In short, even facing the world's gradual loosening, even when the reassurance from personal participation is enveloped by greater-scope uncertainty, the feeling of losing grip on the future can no longer separate me from the world again.
Someone has articulated this more clearly than I. In a dialogue published in Aperture magazine, Professor Hägglund described his concept of "secular faith": if we fairly accept humanity's limitations and fragility without escaping through self-realization fantasies like spiritual practice and religion, then the longing for social connection expressed as "alienation" can transform into pursuit of secular freedom [19].
As a spoiled only child, I really took many detours before understanding this truth: humans are social animals. Giving back is more valuable than taking, creating is more valuable than consuming.

（序）

世界向下探底。在瘟疫的砂漠中，疲于跋涉的人们欣喜地迎接曙光，直到这曙光变成昭彰的白日。遍地的狼藉和罪恶于是显出耀眼的清晰。

无数有关于正义的对决中，人们凭借立场区分敌我，而这和是否带入思考全然无关。西风劲吹，掌勺者却认为火候不够，因为最重要的东西还没有被完全点燃。

信仰笼罩的大陆上，身披道德的人们丝毫不觉饥冷。隔岸而望的灯塔中，PVP爱好者正斗艳争芳。

一浪浪信息洪流之后，精巧的贝壳中传来早已录播好的浪花声。这些遗留海滩的被悉心挑选的人造物，好像在海浪还未席卷之前，就被谁刻意安放在那里。

不知不觉，广袤星辰和虚拟世界都成为又一个百亿美金的投机场。竞价者如此慷慨，仿佛只要不是此时此地的生活，就怎样都好。

已有无数时刻我们被提醒站在了悬崖边，但每一次看似让人坠崖的举动都让这悬崖又延长一些。

这让一些人惊恐，又诱惑另一些人伺机而动。



（一）

载我去机场的优步司机为了避开收费的高速，熟练在小巷里绕出些弯弯拐拐，直到开上一条堵车的大路，成功让预计达到时间增加一刻钟。他好像因此显得不好意思，于是尝试和我交谈起来。

开篇自然是高企的油价，他接着自叙说了起当个网约车司机是个多么劳苦而不赚钱的一门生意……直到旁边一辆时髦的电动车忽然插入队列的动作让他急踩了一脚刹车，这个话题就被一声也许是西语的咒骂骤然止住了。

他指着前方那辆给他带来麻烦的家伙问我，你知道我为什么不喜欢现在的汽车吗？

“为什么？”

“这些车子都是电子系统。它们越来越精细却也越来越容易出错。我当了20年的机械师，但我无法修理自己这台汽车。每次出问题时，修理费又都是他妈的死贵。就和这世界一样。”

就和这世界一样。

师傅说的一点也不错。自从换上自动排挡以来，生活和汽车都变得越来越缺乏操控感。在很多时候，这些愈发精巧复杂的系统让人受益良多；直到某天，我们因为并非本人造成的损坏而收到一张咂舌的修理单……我们当然有理由责怪那些让汽车变得不像汽车的人！

生成式人工智能（Generative AI）在艺术创作领域登堂入室之年，除过让又一批人开始隐约担忧起饭碗被抢之外，还没有在社会层面造成什么实质冲击。虽说如此，这道被刚刚撕开的口子再一次提醒我们去直面一种即将渗入生活方方面面的巨大转折，这种转折甚至可能具有思想层面的颠覆性，即影响人类如何评价自己。

OpenAI的CEO在一次访谈中提到人工智能发展的令人意想不到的趋势：放到仅仅10年前，关于人工智能会如何替代人类工作的时候，所有人都一致认为，首先是蓝领型的、没有训练门槛的体力工作，然后是低端、可重复性的白领工作，最后才是创造类型的白领工作。然而事实是，人工智能的发展路径完全相反，它首先触达的都是那些看似极其复杂的领域，比如自动驾驶，比如艺术创作 [1]。

这种趋势表面费解，但如果我们转换视角看，又显得顺理成章：这些方兴未艾的应用领域无论其输入还是产出，都是高度可数据化的。只要研究者能想出一套逻辑自洽的数字化通路，辅之以足够多的训练样本，人工智能就能学成一套将输入投射到输出去的方法。换句话说，人工智能的瓶颈并不是模型复杂度的问题（何况算法还在不断进化），而是它能否得到足够多的食物。

从这个意义上讲，传统工作本身的难易程度并不是衡量可替代性的标准，是否有足够的初始数据积累才是；而如果一个行业能够有足够的惰性或壁垒去拒绝数字化，那或许就是人工智能最难啃的骨头了。

但话说回来，在一个几乎注定带来先发优势的技术面前，谁又敢拒绝数字化呢？



（三）

我的数字化旅程从2014年下载印象笔记开始，最初只是为了方便在多个平台上都能编辑和查看自己整理的读书笔记。2015年我开通了iCloud，因为照片把手机的储存占满了。而2019年我看到报道中提到，即使硬盘的保存也存在期限。我于是又开始订阅起Office365，终于把所有剩下的在移动硬盘中的个人资料（其中包括一篇一年级的作文《一只乌龟》）也迁移到了云端。

到了今年，我开始认真思考起建立一个更加全面的个人信息集合；为的是在一个单一、至少是有限的平台/应用上，以更细的颗粒度下记录自己的所见所闻——这当然和我的职业不无关系。数据科学界常常引用的一句话是，“你就是你所测量的”，或者其另一个版本，“如果你不能够衡量一件事情，你就不能改进它” [2]。

我大约花了一个月的时间考察，最后锁定了Notion这一集成式的文档类应用（虽然它的愿景还远不止与此），接着又用了两个周末，把原来分散在各个平台的文档和文件全部迁移了进去。

做为红杉基金领投的热门应用，它的2.0版本为原本扁平的文档记事创造性地引入关系型数据库的概念。在此基础之上，用户也可以根据自己的偏好自定义这些信息的展示方式 [3]。

在Notion构建的这个体系下，文档原本核心的内容成为了“文档”这一概念中的仅仅一个部分。文档的元数据和文档的内容被等量齐观。而与之有着同等重要性的，则是文档之间的交互、组合和展示逻辑。

就是说，在打破了那种以内容为核心的割裂性后，文档终于也暴露出一切数字化的东西所共通的那种信息的特性。



（四）

在还没有数字化存储和分销的年代，人们很难将信息和信息的载体分开来看。音乐就是音乐，绘画就是绘画，文字就是文字。直至麦克卢汉喊出“传媒即信息”，我们又把焦点对准了信息的传播路线。这夸大了渠道的作用，反而使我们对更为庞大的信息本身视而不见。

今年以来，文本转图像的生成式AI应用进入大众视野，人们惊讶于这些AI的“脑洞”——这又是被表面化的差异蒙蔽的例子。这些生成式AI并没有“创造些”什么，它们只不过是将由一个渠道得到的信息**翻译**去了另一个渠道，而其中承载的信息完全未变。

一脉相承，大型智能推荐系统所做的也不过是构建了两个不同的函数，将每个顾客的喜好和每个商品的属性都投射到了同一个向量空间里（Embedding）。而在这个空间中，对于机器而言，顾客喜好和商品属性并没有什么本质区别，都是在同一维度中被记录的信息而已。

哪怕只是基于现有的编码方式，我毫不怀疑，人工智能对信息的理解，比人类的意识更加接近信息的本来面貌。而只有在哲学或物理学层面，如果我们把宇宙想象成一个巨大的信息流（熵），事物才能在剥去它们千变万化的存在方式后显出其信息层面的一致性。

“我们想做的是去证明那些个体的、特别的、人类特有的经历不过是一些庞大的形式系统下面极其表面化的闪烁而己。”福柯的这句话既然瞄准了人，又何尝不是同等地瞄准了这世间的万物呢？

在所有有关“尽头”的思考里，科幻作品都是绕不开的高峰。今年我给自己定下的两个多年规划之一，就是系统性地阅读和了解科幻作品。

不同于风险投资家们所规划的那种“未来的终止”（逆向思考是一个时髦的词儿：十年内，大部分人都会……），幻想作品描述的是“未来的展开”：切断与具象现实的纽带，在一种整体的，更广阔的不确定之中，幻想家可以更为浪漫化地发掘或者预测人类文明的一切，而不仅是科技发展的可能性。

正如农耕文明和现代文明间的差异并不是以水平扩张或线性的复杂度来衡量，能够实现外星殖民的文明必然有着与现代社会根本上不同的**哲学**框架。诸如猜疑链、黑暗森林这样的构思，就代表了以**宇宙为尺度所**进行的思考而产生的，完全不隶属当代观念的理性和道德。

整个宇宙中可能发生的故事，和地球上发生的故事之间，最根本的差异是尺度问题（即使以光速旅行，前往相邻星系的征途仍是以世纪为单位，而这段时间里可以容纳多少个技术爆炸啊）。和经典力学相似，人类的知识到目前所构建的一切也有一个仅在中等尺度下的适用范围；而探究这个范围之外的东西，则完全可以重构我们对世界的理解方式。

这也并不只是科幻作家的责任。这项工程虽然进展缓慢但早已开始。我总以为，有些心智可以在不断的磨砺中领悟到常规波长以外的运动模式：随着年龄增加，芒格和巴菲特看起来越来越肆无忌惮，而某些马拉松运动员有着一副苦行僧般的面孔。

“绘画的极致（是失明），是在安拉的黑暗中看见事物。 [4]”说实话，我还挺喜欢这个任务的。



（六）

詹姆斯·韦伯望远镜在历经漫长的准备和调整后 [5]，终于不负众望地传回一幅幅细腻精美的深空图片。这些图像炫丽而静谧，和这充斥庞大虚无和暗流涌动的宇宙本身大相径庭。这其实是令人敬畏的，仅在这巨大天穹的毫不起眼的小小角落，如果我们仔细剖开，就已经展露出永不被理解的无限。

看到这些图像时，我常常想，这个以精确透镜和尖端科技组合成的仪器，和那些在摩天大楼楼顶供游客投币使用的望远镜，其实没有任何区别。它们把那些极远处的景观拉到身边，满足了我们难以被抑制的窥伺欲。

迄今为止，我们是这样的幸运，以至于在我们目及之处，宇宙除了稀疏但无所不在的黑暗和美不胜收的风景，再没有什么令人惊奇、值得一提的东西。但你完全可以想象，总有一天，这些数字信号会真的传回来一些什么了不得的图像，那个时候，整个人类也许就会像一个刚刚偷窥到苟且之事的变态一样，同时感到惶恐、尴尬和满足吧。

在动荡的地缘环境和潜伏的滞胀危机中，有着祖传乐天精神的英国网友自嘲道：如今的一切都像极了70年代的英国病（The British disease），除了没有好听的音乐 [6]。

也许有，但不容易找到，因为最流行的现代音乐并不仅仅为了服务听觉。

自从多媒体这个概念出现，音乐逐渐开始依附在某些需要调动视觉的场景中，如迪厅（电子舞曲）或短视频（洗脑神曲），这使得它们和在更为高效的渠道上的信息（视觉信息占人类所有感官获取信息的70%以上）达成“捆绑销售”，相辅相成地变成了病毒式传播的怪物。

从更广义的方面来说，凯文凯利提出的互联网十二趋势之一的“重混（remix）” [7]，也展现在不同艺术形式之间的融合之中。抛弃低密度的、单频道的食物，重混带来密度增长，立体的感官刺激当然也更令人欲罢不能。

从节奏感强烈的舞曲和差强人意的虚拟现实头盔往前看，明天是什么？

是渴望被信息填满的我们啊。

经历了数年的重金出击后，B站引进的日本新番终于逐渐减少 [8]。出于情怀，动漫爱好者多有不满可以理解；但从每一个方面看，这种趋势又十分合理地难以逆转。还好，在中国的动漫版权收购走下坡路之前，我已经从二次元离开了。

这并不是因为我已对此感到烦腻或者那些对动漫爱好者的刻板偏见。我的”毕业“源自自然的脱离，在番剧被萌系治愈和龙傲天穿越题材统治的当下，它确实再不能给予我所寻求的那份快乐。

也不单是动漫，如今的大多数娱乐性质的内容都缺乏惊喜：程式化的情节推动，一眼望穿的人物性格，我猜，王尔德要是体验过一把如今的消遣，肯定会被无聊致死。

我一直报以这样的偏见：不同人的爱好确实有着相当的高下之分。因为那说到底证明了一个人获得愉悦的途径是什么。因此我为如今的青年感到可惜，他们如果不花费力气去搜寻，那眼皮子底下的娱乐活动几乎没有任何营养，又或者他们并不会试图以可以获取营养的方式去观看/体验——而这是一个内容生产和消费之间相互作用的使彼此退化的循环（打破这个循环意味着缺乏成瘾性的娱乐形式，以及投资回报率更低效的娱乐行业，这条世界线当然缺乏任何吸引力）。

基于希望的叙事，永远是人类可以拥有的最好的叙事方式。但是哪怕我们放弃希望，颓废和消磨也是有巨大区别的（那其中蕴含的能量密度完全不同）。而我庆幸的是，我怀旧的并不只是出于对童年和私人经历的熟稔，而是这些作品确实是井喷式的黄金时代的代表，它们从任何意义上都比新发表的文艺更经得起时间检验。它们开拓了人类的理想、想象力和可能性，哪怕是在如何寻死这方面。

年中的时候，一篇《当资产负债表不想奋斗了》曾在网络上激起不小的波澜 [9]。我虽仅能从对动漫产业的观测管中窥豹，但日本失落的三十年间整个民族从心气被扭曲到丧失心气的发展过程确实是一本深刻的教材。这既使人唏嘘也引人警醒，毕竟中国的青年也开始沾染上躺平的哲学了。

于是，当然有这样自感责任重大的先觉者出来喊话：时代呼唤低需氧人才！[10]

他妈的，你有资格呼唤么？



（九）

当一个打工人向老板提出新点子的时候，他往往需要联系公司愿景和行业趋势进行宏观叙事。摄影师的灵感则出现在极细微极具体的瞬间，这需要他保持敏锐，观察入微。

我经常为这两种视角下映射出的事物的不同形态感到惊奇。

生活是如此的复杂，当我们站得比亲历者远一点看，当我们想用一两个句子概括一段历史，当我们试图对事件“降维处理”，我们总会得到一个抹平个体差异结果：整体是稳中有升，大方向上越来越幸福，总的来说实现了巨大飞跃——人类拥有的统计工具毕竟只能达到这个程度。

但人类的同情心不应浮在一千米的高空向下俯瞰。



（十）小诗三首

其一 · 致庇护所里的人
在告诉我应该怎么做之前
请务必做完你能够做的事
宏大理想也不是不能打动我
但都还没长跑完 就先别急着说你的跑法
适应任何路况
为什么变得谨慎
一个民族有一个民族的诗抄


其二 · 致执牛耳者
不知是哪个神明想出的点子
一方造出更高纯度的氯气
一方造出更高纯度的金属钠
等等 小民我只是来讨点盐啊
乌鸦总忍不住去啄其他动物的尾巴
谁才是乌鸦
一段历史有一段历史的厨房辩论


其三 · 致清醒的跋涉
情绪释放是一种轻松的冲浪
寻求真相则是一场艰辛的爬坡
拨开迷雾 你的大后方有愚昧的败类和无知的圣徒
（他们并不容易彼此分辨）
哪怕火炬并不走身边经过
我也尽力保持干燥
这样做真的有好处吗
一代人有一代人的长征



（十一）

我从高中开始到如今的十余年间所接触的文学几乎都是西方和日本的，对于中国文学，除了几本古文小说之外，再没有做出任何努力。这毕竟令人愧疚，而且产生思维方式上的隔膜。

在这一点上我是谦虚的。我无法在还未进入这个文化语境之前，就随随便便地评论所有发生的事。这既是对这个民族厚重历史的不敬，也是对自己思想的菲薄。

况且，作为一个局外人，我毕竟无法亲历这些持续着巨变的日子。而往后隔不了几年，我于异乡漂泊的日子就会赶上在故土生活的计时。对于这样的游子，祖国当然只会变得越来越遥远和陌生。这令人感伤，但也提供一个当旁观者的契机。

但无论视角如何变化，人这辈子永远都想寻个归宿。为了这身传承千年的骨血，我因此要求自己从头开始阅读这首黄河般浩荡的史诗，我要求自己系统性地、重新地认识这片黄土和土地上的人民。

这是一项艰巨的任务，让我们从这里开始吧。



（十二）

今年夏天，在耶鲁的艺术博物馆里，我看到了一副来自中国的摄影作品。照片拍摄于陕西的陇县，图像中三个女人跪在青草稀疏的土地上，穿着白色的衣服，围着白色的头巾，手里拿着裹上白纸的木棒。她们正在哭丧 [11]。

那看上去像是一个春天的清晨，闪光灯不自然地打在她们身上。中间和左边的二人掩鼻啜泣，最右的妇女嘴巴大张，好像正洪亮地哭出声来。她们的脸上显示出那种高原居民常有的团块状斑纹。但因为是黑白照片，并不能清楚分辨那是在寒风中被吹刮出的，或是在长久的劳作、日晒下疏于清洁的面容。她们身材粗壮，如野土地上顽强生长的仙人掌一般，在遍地的困苦中，只需些许幸福就能存活下来。

我并不感到如何震惊，但这张照片让我具像化地理解了一些关于乡村的叙事。我近来所读到的小说中，近代中国乡村的普通人家娶媳妇的偏好首先是身材壮实。这照例意味着这个姑娘经得操劳、不易害病，生孩子以外也可以像个成年男子下地耕作。在穷困的时代，这样的选择无比符合经济学。

……但这张照片是2000年拍摄的啊！



（十三）

在《激荡三十年》中，吴晓波从商业变革的角度讲述了改革开放以来中国社会巨大而曲折的变化（这个视角狡猾又合理地避开了很多不能谈论的东西）。我强调这个词——曲折，这意味着这个囊括十亿人的经济改革的摸索中出现过不可忽视的波动。我们可以把这种起伏理解为时间性上的不均衡。

而空间性上的不均衡，则体现在改革先行试验区和意识形态远为牢固的地区之间的差异上。

我以前说过，“美国梦”以私人叙事的闭塞性，无视了叙事者对社会所应担当的责任。而与之相对的“中国梦”，则以宏观叙事的缩放，忽略一切故事中始终存在的差异和起伏。一旦认识到中国社会的发展在两个维度上的多样性，我就不得不对那些单一的线性叙事保持警惕（仅从公关角度，我当然理解为了对冲外国报道中充满偏见的“阴间滤镜”，官方自有一套“阳间”滤镜的必要性），而这正是许多狂热者很会做的事。

我们常听到的一些代表警告但又没有完全警告的词：忍受阵痛、时代灰尘……这些语词用得越真诚，我就越为这种脱离感到心痛。

普通人的苦难是真实具体而刻骨铭心的，但庇护所里的人体会不到。正如另一个意识形态的叙事中，免于被匮乏侵扰的富人批评穷人不够刻苦，缺乏思考。

读过《人世间》的小说，我看到的是一群被压抑的小人物家常般的唠叨和对话，但思想先进的人却说它“史诗般展现波澜壮阔的中国社会巨变” [12]。

哪里来的史诗呢？并不是所有颠沛的人都被称作奥德修斯的。还是说你充满正义地推己及人，觉得所有人都得到命运的照护，过着毫无破损的日子，并且理所应当有着一颗英雄般的心呢？



（十四）

在不只一本小说中，我都看到这样的情节：官场前辈都对他们报以希望的后辈讲到一个道理，说一个人一旦下定决心当官，就必须“明智地斩断与草根阶层的亲密关系” [13]。

我们不能说这种考虑毫无道理，毕竟真正的理想如宗教一般，绝不能被私人欲念扭曲其纯粹性。这种说法也十分可笑，因为它显然背叛了这种理想的初衷，而似乎只有官员以实际行动脱离了群众，他的仕途才会顺畅起来。

不管怎么说，我们有理由相信这种选拔方式被传承了下来，因为我们听到太多的话语，那是但凡有一点人情味的耳朵，都会怀疑自己听错的。

我们还常常能听到另一套战斗号令的语境：五天时间打一场“攻坚战” [14]，打响阻断传播“闪电战” [15]，武汉“十天大会战” [16]，贵阳市凌晨四点测核酸与病毒“赛跑” [17]……

和前些日子里被调侃的互联网黑话相似（并不是相似在被人调侃这一点上），这些语言习惯当然不是凭空产生，甚至是说，它们都可以被追溯到这个组织成立初期所经历的事件，以及对这些事件的解决方法。

这哪里像是跳出了历史周期率呢？



（十五）

路径依赖就是，面对政治风波和不和拍的汹涌舆情，必须采取强硬的手段加强控制。

路径依赖就是，要保持对群众平等而抽象的博爱就必须离群众远一点，远到他们的噪声再不能干扰宏观叙事。

路径依赖就是，以高强度的不可持续的动员去解决一切遇到的问题，然后祈祷这些问题不会长期存在。

路径依赖就是，用殉道者当路标要求所有信众，歌颂牺牲和损害自我的付出，让他们感到满足是一种罪恶，就像基督徒把现世当做一条通往天堂的泪谷 [18]。

路径依赖就是，在不确定的事件中使用“不提倡、不取缔、不宣传”为基础的不透明的考核体系，永不担责、永不放权、永不犯错。

路径依赖就是，始终采用过去得到正反馈的方法，直到出现许多牺牲者，直到这个方法被现实证明不再有用。



（十六）一些短句

1.0
隐入尘烟这个说法还是太轻巧了。大多数时候，不是漫天沙尘来不及躲，就是有人希望受难者能消失得无踪无迹，而且越快越好。
我想，那该是没入尘烟才对味哩。

2.0
有些人嘲笑美国对华政策的“合作，对抗，竞争”是自顾自的一厢情愿。
还是这些人，要求别人在事态变好的时候歌颂，在不明朗的时候噤声，在显然行不通的时候忍耐。

3.0
以最佳的善意来拟人：美国像是碇源堂，他有一个天下皆知的正义计划和背后的小算盘；中国像是明日香，她相信拯救愚民是精英的任务。
反正跟这两种人打交道都挺累的。

4.0
苏格拉底曾对犬儒学派的人说：您的肮脏是一种虚荣 [18]。这句话告诉我们，人不能把自己看得太了不起了。
出于相同原因，我在重读柳宗元的《愚溪诗序》时笑出了声。
不要和自我意识太强的人交朋友，哪怕他们表面上并不自私。



（十七）

对离群索居的迷恋曾贯穿了我整个青春期。我总是逃不出同一个问题：人会去往何处？我曾求索于神秘学和宗教，但发现它们与现实的龃龉；我曾沉溺于纤细的感情，因为美的一次性是对永恒的叛逃。办法好像就这么几个。不论中西，这个议题的解决方式向来如此：你必须离俗世远一点，才能达到那个忘掉俗世的抽离状态。

我以前总以为，必然存在一种更符合我心性的世俗世界的替代品，否则这种缺乏难以解释这个在这个世界居住时必然遇见的混乱和苦痛。但后来我变得平和了些，因为我阅读历史，串珠成线，开始以发展的眼光观测这个二级混沌系统中发生和即将发生的变化。然后我参与工作，投入劳动，亲身推动项目的展开，这种掌控感让人愈发安心。

更为基础地，我的工作让我认同数据主义，因此我会说：互动比孤立更有价值。

总之，即便面对世界渐进式的松动，即便因亲身参与而带来的安心感被更大范围的不确定性所包裹，对未来失去把握的感觉也不能再次将我和世界分开。

有人比我阐述得更加清楚。在光圈杂质发表的一篇对谈录中，海格伦德教授讲述了他提出的“世俗信仰“的概念：如果我们公正地接纳人类社会的有限性和脆弱性，而不以灵修、宗教一类自我实现的幻想为逃避，那么以”异化“形式表达的对社会联系的渴望就可以转化为对世俗自由的追寻 [19]。

作为被溺爱过的独生子女，我真的走了好些弯路才明白这个道理：人是社会动物。回馈比索取更有价值，创造比消费更有价值。
