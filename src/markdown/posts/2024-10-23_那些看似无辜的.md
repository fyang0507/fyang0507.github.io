More than a century ago, Romain Rolland wrote at the beginning of *Lives of Great Men*:
"How heavy the air around us is! Old Europe lies unconscious in a thick and corrupt atmosphere. Vulgar materialism suppresses thought and obstructs the actions of governments and individuals. Society suffocates to death in clever, base selfishness."

In the half-century that followed, Europe endured the devastation of two world wars and became the frontline of global bipolar confrontation amid trends and conspiracies grander than the Marshall Plan... Europe did not collapse entirely, but it has indeed never fully recovered its most flourishing influence.
Recently, I've watched it stammer and evade after the Nord Stream pipeline incident, watched it make decisions in two regional conflicts that don't entirely serve its own interests... Europe has not merely lost its influence—it is fundamentally abandoning its dignity.
I don't say this with a tone of regret. I was inspired by the heroic stories in *Lives of Great Men*, but visiting Europe again nine years later, I'm also fascinated to observe that Romain Rolland's heartfelt writing motivation has failed to make this continent any more clear-sighted。

I only learned about Ghent from social media—medieval Europe's second-largest city after Paris. Strolling through it, I was amazed by both the completeness of its ancient architectural preservation and the grandeur of its scale. Its accumulated history spills over like wine from a cup; you can smell the aged essence from any sculpture on these streets, any stone slab, any hanging bell. The local guide pointed to a tavern (Café Den Turk) and said its owner once participated in the Crusades.

Ghent was historically a gathering place for crowds, with many of its buildings funded by guilds—boatmen's, tanners', tax collectors', textile workers'... These emerging bourgeoisie once enjoyed their moment of glory in this prosperous commercial center that once dominated Europe, and then came the "Revolt of Ghent."
This uprising was launched by Ghent citizens against new taxes imposed by Charles V—Holy Roman Emperor, and himself a native of Ghent—to expand his wars. To suppress the rebellion, Charles V spent nearly half a year traveling from Spain to Ghent, gathering five thousand soldiers along the way.
The people of Ghent did not resist... Charles V entered the city with pomp, moved into his palace, and began dealing with the rebels.
In the end, the people of Ghent were ordered to wear robes, go barefoot, and carry nooses around their necks as they marched from city hall to the king's palace to beg forgiveness.
The people of Ghent have not forgotten this event. To ensure they don't forget, they even named a locally brewed beer after it. Ghent residents call themselves "noose bearers," and they reenact this scene every year at festivals, celebrating their ancestors' spirit of resistance.

After hearing this story, I found myself not recognizing the word "resistance" anymore. When I think of resistance, I habitually think of martyrs, ideals, heroes—but I would never think of any beer...
Half out of curiosity, half to verify my suspicion, I asked the local guide who had just finished the story: Why are Ghent's buildings so well-preserved, even after World War II?
He said it was because this wasn't a strategic location, but was used as a German logistics base. From occupation to liberation, no serious armed conflicts occurred here.
I was certain then that the term "people's war" does have its scope of application.

On the beautiful archway of Ghent's Fish Market, there are male and female figures on either side, representing the two rivers flowing through Ghent; the male figure was carved based on the face of a playboy who lived in Ghent during the construction period.
If your ancestors lived in such a playful manner, you surely wouldn't take many things too seriously either.

Ilya Ehrenburg wrote in his memoirs: "(1950) Europe lived a poor, uneasy, panicked life. In France and Italy, the workers' struggle had already failed by 1947, but everyone still felt the struggle was continuing."
Europeans don't know how to revolt, and even if they did revolt, it would be a leisurely revolution. Europeans are too good at living—they start drinking with breakfast, and even the small convenience stores at train stations carry two or three types of cheese spreads and freshly baked bread. Walking through alleys, those roadside rooms are warmly furnished, often with bright fresh flowers arranged on dining tables... They regard many things as slightly more important than the future.

The guide pointed to a building painted yellow and said it was the only wooden building left in Ghent's old town. He said there was a legend among Ghent residents about this house: the mistress swore to her husband who had gone off to war that she wouldn't change clothes until he returned, but when the husband failed to return for a long time, the house gradually took on the color of this steadfast lady's underwear.
In this crude joke, I saw Ghent's long but lighthearted history. Romain Rolland used such heavy words in his admonition—he was the anomaly instead.

一个多世纪以前，罗曼·罗兰在《名人传》开篇写道：

“我们周围的空气多沉重！老大的欧罗巴在重浊与腐败的气氛中昏迷不醒。鄙俗的物质主义镇压着思想，阻挠着政府与个人的行动。社会在乖巧卑下的自私自利中窒息以死。“

自那之后的半个世纪，欧洲历经两次世界大战的浩劫，又在比马歇尔计划更为宏大的趋势和阳谋中，成为世界两极对抗的前线……欧洲并没有一蹶不振，但也确实再没完全回复它最为鼎盛的影响力。

而最近，我看着它在北溪管道事件后的支支吾吾顾左右而言他，看着它在两场区域冲突中做出并不完全符合自身利益的举措……欧洲不仅是失去了影响力，它根本是在放弃自己的尊严。

我并不是带以遗憾的口气说这句话的；我振奋于《名人传》中的英雄故事，但九年之后再次游历欧洲，我也饶有兴致地看着罗曼·罗兰痛切心扉的写作动机并没有让这片大陆变得更加清醒。



我是从社交媒体上才知道根特——中世纪欧洲仅次于巴黎的第二大城市。漫步其中，我惊讶于它对古代建筑保存之完整和其规模本身的宏大。它的累累历史像杯中满溢而出的葡萄酒，你可以从这些街衢的任何一个雕塑，任何一个石板，任何一口吊钟嗅到充满年头的气息：当地的向导指着一个酒馆（Café Den Turk）说，它的老板曾经参加了十字军东征。

根特在历史上人潮聚集，其许多建筑都是当年由公会（Guild）出资修建——船夫的，皮匠的，收税官的，纺织业的……这些新兴资产阶级在这个曾睥睨欧洲的繁华商业重镇曾烜赫一时，然后就发生了“根特起义（Revolt of Ghent）”。



这场起义是根特市民反对查理五世——神圣罗马皇帝，一个根特人——为扩大战争而新增的税负而发起的。查理五世为了镇压起义，用了近半年的从西班牙去往根特，并沿途召集了五千名士兵。

根特人没有抵抗……查理五世堂而皇之地进了城，住进了自己的宫殿，开始着手处理叛乱分子。

事件最后，根特人被命令身穿长袍，赤脚，并颈负绞索，从市政厅游行至国王的宫殿请罪。

根特人没有忘记这件事情，为了不至于忘记，他们还特地以此命名了一种当地酿造的啤酒。根特居民自称“套索人（noose bearers）”，他们会在每年的节日上重现这个节目，庆祝自己祖先的反抗精神。



听完这个故事，我发现自己好像不认识反抗这个词了。提起反抗，我习惯于想起先烈，想起理想，想起英雄，但就是不会想起任何啤酒……

半是出于好奇，半是出于实证自己的猜想，我问那个讲完故事的当地向导说：为什么哪怕历经了第二次世界大战，根特的建筑群却这么完好呢？

他说，因为这里不是什么战略要地，而被用作德军的后勤地。这里从被侵占到得到解放期间，并没有发生什么严重的武装冲突。

我确信了，人民战争这个词毕竟有它的适用范围。



根特的水产市场（Fish Market）的漂亮拱门上左右各有一男一女的形象，代表流经根特的两条河流；而其男性的形象是根据建造时期根特城里一位花花公子的面容雕刻而成的。

如果你的先辈们是以这样戏谑的方式生活的，你肯定也不会较真地去看待很多事情。



伊利亚·爱伦堡在回忆录中写道：“（1950年）欧洲过着贫穷、不安、慌张的生活。在法国和意大利，工人的战斗早在1947年即已失败，但大家都觉得战斗仍在继续。”

欧洲人是不会革命的，就算革命，那也是悠闲的革命。欧洲人太会生活了，他们从早饭就开始喝酒，火车站的不大的便利店里也有两三种酪浆和现场烘焙的面包。打小巷中穿过，那些道旁的房间里陈设温馨，经常还会在饭桌上插满娇艳的鲜花……他们把很多东西都看得比未来更重要一点。

向导指着一幢漆成黄色的建筑说，那是根特老城里唯一的木质建筑了。他说根特居民间流传着这样的传说，说这家的女主人向当兵远征的丈夫发誓说不见他归来她就不换衣物，但丈夫久别未归，于是这栋房子就慢慢变成了这位坚守初心的女士的内裤的颜色。

我在这个不雅的笑话中看到了根特虽然漫长但是轻松的历史。罗曼·罗兰的谆告中用了那么沉重的词，他才是那个异类啊。
