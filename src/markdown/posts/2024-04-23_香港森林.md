At the immigration checkpoint entering Hong Kong, the officer at the window next to mine questioned a young woman: "What is the purpose of your visit to Hong Kong? How many days will you be staying? Are you pregnant?"
After receiving a negative response, the officer flashed a smile—the kind of smile a quality inspector gives to a product that has passed inspection.
Welcome, mainland middle class. Welcome to the Hong Kong Forest.

From the express bridge connecting the airport to Hong Kong Island, looking out through the port windows, the massive cantilever arms of container cranes stand in formation along the bridge like soldiers awaiting review. Yet right beside them, gleaming towers rise like prisms, distilling blues from the earth and sky that don't naturally exist in this landscape. We can imagine that within these narrow apartments, behind those countless small windows, there are equally blue-tinted gentle fairy tales, precisely compartmentalized and wrapped.
For the fairy tale to continue, Hong Kong's middle class must abide by the first warning and response of the Trisolaran civilization:
Do not look. Do not look. Do not look.
Do not look, and you won't glimpse the soot-blackened walls in the lightless alleyways.
Do not look, and you won't see the swarms of flying ants beating their massive wings across the sky during rainy season.
Do not look, and you won't lock eyes with strangers sharing tables in the bustling cha chaan tengs.
Do not look, and no matter how the world changes, never ask what happens on the other side of the river.

At dusk over Victoria Harbour, most of the neon signs atop the skyscrapers have lit up, but Lee Kum Kee's hasn't. Not that it failed to light up—rather, its sign appears to have no neon decoration at all. Yet even so, in this shoulder-to-shoulder forest of towers, it doesn't seem overly conspicuous despite its dated appearance.
Hong Kong's first skyscraper wasn't completed until 1973, but the development that followed became unstoppable, continuing until the land was filled with towers, until there was no room for more. Most of the buildings standing around Victoria Harbour today shot up during the twenty years around the turn of the century.
Within Hong Kong's modern elements, you can always detect something with a bit of age to it, like aged marinade seeping from fresh pig's trotters—a flavor only understood by humans who are equally close to their expiration date.
This reveals the dark side of Masayoshi Son's "time machine" theory. When people from rising regions visit once-advanced places, they don't first marvel at the (unseen, former) prosperity but at the (apparent through comparison with the more modern) decay.
I believe these dense clusters of buildings in the harbor are sophons that people from the previous era projected onto today's Hong Kong. In that moment when everyone was racing to reach toward the sky and the world's summit, no one imagined that these massive concrete and steel behemoths were such high-dimensional objects: their enormous etchings would slowly unfold across the river of time—when every tower stood surrounded by other towers, when people awakened from the myth of creation—
Hong Kong's skyline had been locked down.
Hong Kong had been locked down.

Saturday noon, on the pedestrian bridges of Mong Kok, oxford cloth spreads along the railings. Headscarved women begin gathering in small groups, sitting on the ground as voices gradually rise to a din. These women show no interest in passersby; they simply call to friends, pouring bulk beverages into disposable cups, or opening video chat apps to loudly converse through speakers with blurry, swaying figures on the other end.
I couldn't immediately make sense of what was happening. It didn't have the tension of a political rally, nor did it show any signs of marketplace commercial activity. But people were indeed gathering in increasing numbers. It wasn't until some patrol officers walked by and I stopped them to ask that I learned this was a typical weekend leisure activity for Hong Kong's domestic workers.
The next day, I witnessed an even grander gathering in Central. Here, no one wore headscarves, and more sophisticated settlements had developed: they built individual compartments with cardboard, some even pitched tents. Someone brought out a microphone and began singing as if no one else existed; others set up tripods to dance with friends for TikTok livestreams; some started eyebrow-threading businesses.
And all of this was happening on the bridges.
The bridges extend horizontally through this jungle of vertically growing towers, like root systems spread throughout the city. They spend five days a week tirelessly delivering nutrients to the CBD, finally growing voices on weekends. This tidal change in the bridges is like someone regularly dipping Hong Kong's negative into developing solution: beneath the purely functional exterior of municipal infrastructure, repeatedly excavating the mushrooms growing underground in this urban forest.
Ah! Mushrooms, while you can, pour out your hearts and tend to each other's mycelia! Because when you return to those tiny compartments, you must still obey the forest's laws, must fold your loneliness, must choose silence for the sake of efficiency.

入境香港的海关通道，我隔壁窗口的审查员对着一个年轻女孩问道：请问您来香港的目的是什么？请问您停留几天？

请问您是否怀孕？

得到否定的回答后，审查员露出一抹微笑（这是质检员面向质检合格的产品的微笑）。

欢迎你，大陆中产阶级。欢迎来到香港森林。

从连结机场和港岛的高速大桥上向左舷望出去，集装箱起吊机巨大的悬臂林立桥畔如同等待检阅。但就在它们身旁，一幢幢辉煌的高楼棱镜般提炼出这片大地和天空中本不存在的青色。我们可以想象，在这些狭窄的公寓里，在那一片片小窗之后，有同样泛着青色的，被精确区隔和包裹的温柔童话。

要想让童话继续下去，香港中产阶级必须恪守三体文明的第一声遵告和回答：

不要眺望。不要眺望。不要眺望。

不要眺望，你就不会窥见不透光的巷道里被油烟熏黑的墙壁。

不要眺望，你就不会抬头看清那雨季中扑腾巨大翅膀的漫天蚁群。

不要眺望，你就不会在人来人往的冰室里和对面拼桌的眼色撞个满怀。

不要眺望，不管世界如何变化，永远不要问起，河的对岸发生了什么。

傍晚的维多利亚港，大多数摩天大楼顶部的灯牌都亮起了灯，李锦记的却没有。不是没有点亮，而是它的招牌看上去像是根本没有霓虹装饰。但即使这样，在这摩肩接踵的高楼的森林里，它居然也没有因其陈旧而显得过分招摇。

香港的首栋摩天大楼在1973年才落成，但接下来的开发工程就一发不可收拾，直至那片土地被高楼填满，直到再也放不下更多的高楼。如今维多利亚港矗立的楼群，大部分是在世纪之交那二十年的时间拔地而起的。

香港的现代元素之中你总能咂摸出一些有点年头的东西出来，像是鲜亮的猪蹄之中渗出的陈年老卤，这卤汁也只有和它一样快过期的人类才能理解其中的况味。

我们由此可以发现孙正义“时光机器”理论的背阳面。当后起之秀地区的人们来到曾经的先进之地，他们首先不会感慨它的（不被看见的曾经的）繁华而是感慨它的（通过和更现代的对比而显出的）凋零。

我想，这片港湾里的密集的楼群，正是上一个时代的人投向今天的香港的智子。在那个争先恐后向天空和世界之巅伸出双手的时刻，没有人想到这些用水泥和钢筋浇筑的庞然大物，居然是这样一个高维物体：它们的巨大蚀刻，终于在时间长河里慢慢展开——当每一栋高楼旁边都站满另一栋高楼的时候，当人们从造物的神话中回过神来——

香港的天际线已经被锁死了。

香港已经被锁死了。

周六中午，旺角的人行天桥上，一张张牛津布沿着栏杆铺展开来。戴头巾的妇女三三两两开始聚集，席地而坐，人声逐渐鼎沸。这些妇女并不对行人有任何兴趣；她们只是呼朋引伴，把量贩装的饮料倒进一次性杯子里；或者开启视频聊天程序，和另一头模糊晃动的人影通过扬声器和她们大声对话。

我对当下发生的事情一时摸不着头脑。它看起来没有政治集会前的紧张感，也没有显示出任何集市的商业活动的迹象。但人确实是越来越多。直至旁边走过几个巡警，我拉住他们询问，才知道这是香港的家政服务人员周末的典型休憩活动。

第二天，我在中环看见了更为宏大的聚集。这里没有人戴头巾，并且发展出了更为高阶的聚落：她们用纸板建起了一个个隔间，有的甚至搭起了帐篷。有人拿出话筒，旁若无人地唱起歌来；有人立起三脚架和姐妹在镜头前跳舞做抖音直播；有人搞起了修眉生意。

而这一切都是在天桥上进行的。

天桥在一片纵向生长的高楼的丛林中横向延展，像是遍布这个城市根系。它用一周五天的时间不疲倦地向CBD传递营养，终于在周末长出了喉咙。天桥这种潮汐变化，就好像有人把香港的底片规律性地浸入显影液之中：在市政功能性设施的纯粹外表之下，一次次将这个城市森林中那些长在地底的蘑菇翻掘出土。

啊！蘑菇们，趁着现在，好好倾吐和照拂彼此的菌丝吧！因为在重回那小小的隔间背后，你们仍然要听从森林的法则，仍然要收起彼此的孤独，仍然要为了效率选择沉默。
