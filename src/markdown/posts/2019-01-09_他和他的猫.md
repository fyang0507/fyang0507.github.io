A six-foot-tall deep-sea fishing champion, a member of the Lost Generation, a soldier, a mental patient, a boxing enthusiast, and an "ordinary Cuban" left the late-night Sloppy Joe's bar. He gazed dreamily at the lighthouse's massive cylindrical beam of light, then dragged his long shadow and a men's restroom back to the mansion with the town's largest private pool—a wedding gift from his second wife's uncle. Snow White, the six-toed cat at home, had no idea (and wouldn't have cared if she did) that soon after, the name of this housemate—Hemingway—would become the designation people would give to their entire clan.
I stand in the courtyard where Snow White's descendants lounge about, towering tropical plants rustling in the onshore Atlantic breeze. Sunlight filters down through a small cluster of bamboo leaves in dappled patterns, while the ceiling fan on the main building's second floor turns lazily, bringing from afar that unique tropical sense of coolness. Across in the carriage house, on a small round table in the center of the second-floor study sits a Royal typewriter, with mounted antlered deer heads nailed to the walls and a military backpack placed on the floor against the wall.
He would enter his study every day at six in the morning and leave at noon; afternoons and evenings were spent deep-sea fishing or following doctor's orders to execute the authoritative prescription for his family's hereditary bipolar disorder: heavy drinking. Hangovers might become routine, but regardless, during a certain nine-year period, this typewriter had continuously spelled out words like these: A Farewell to Arms; Men Without Women; Green Hills of Africa; The Snows of Kilimanjaro... If I had once been captivated by Yukio Mishima's delicate trajectory of a beautiful youth's cliff-like maturation—his "aesthetic" life path—then Hemingway's existence was simply too **"American."**
He seemed to have experienced it all—as a deep-sea fishing champion, a member of the Lost Generation, a soldier, a mental patient, a boxing enthusiast, an "ordinary Cuban," but perhaps most importantly, as a robust and tough man, he displayed a philosophy shaped by "action"—a mode of thinking diametrically opposed to Kantian contemplation—with this country's characteristic romantic restlessness and mission-driven sense, along with a deeply rooted self-centeredness that carried out his own justice.
In my conception, he was an unqualified representative of the "Lost Generation." The reason is simple: he wasn't lost at all; he had found the definitive form of heroic expression quite early. The truly lost one was his friend—the poet with a dreamer's temperament—Fitzgerald, whose talent originated mainly from heaven-sent sensitivity and melancholy. Unlike Fitzgerald's longing for unattainable dreams, Hemingway's talent stemmed primarily from worship of **ideals**; one could say that Fitzgerald's words were the leakage of sorrow, while Hemingway's words were the overflow of strength.
I should say that I had never realized the possibility that a writer could exist in Hemingway's manner. The people I admire—Maugham, Proust, Yukio Mishima...—their writing was invariably achieved through "rejection of life"; while as a very American writer, Hemingway's writing was achieved through "traversing life." Put another way, Hemingway belonged to that rare breed who practiced their pursuit through "action" rather than "imagination."
But rather than saying I envy this way of living, I should say I deeply understand that this lifestyle fundamentally conflicts with my own temperament. Yet after all, I do live in his homeland, and perhaps this country's inherent pragmatism will transform me beyond recognition. I might even welcome such a transformation with open arms.

一名身高六英尺的海钓冠军、迷惘的一代、军人、精神病患、拳击爱好人士、“普通的古巴人”离开了深夜的邋遢乔（Sloppy Joe）酒吧，他迷离望向灯塔巨大的柱形光亮，然后拖着长长的影子和一个男厕，踱回坐拥镇上最大私人泳池的洋房——他第二任妻子的叔叔送给他们的结婚礼物。家里的六趾猫咪白雪并不知道（就算知道也不在乎），不久之后，这个同居者的名字，海明威，将成为了人们给予它们这一族的称谓。

我站在白雪后代居留（四处躺倒）的庭园里，高耸的热带绿植在大西洋的向岸风中簌簌响着。而阳光从一小撮斑竹的叶条中被淅沥沥地筛下来，主楼二层的吊扇懒洋洋地转动，远远地带来一种热带地区独有的清凉感。对面的马车库里，二楼书室中央一张不大的圆桌上摆放着皇家打字机，墙上钉着长着犄角的鹿头标本，靠墙处的地板上则摆放着一个军旅背包。

他每日六时走进自己的书房，中午时分离开；下午和晚上则出海钓鱼、或遵照医嘱执行针对家族遗传型躁郁症的权威处方：酗酒。宿醉也许会成为常态，但无论如何，其中的某九年间，这个打字机上曾经连续拼下了这样一些单词：永别了、武器；没有女人的男人；非洲的青山；乞力马扎罗的雪……如果说以前的我曾醉心于三岛由纪夫纤细少年断崖式成长的“美形”式的生活轨迹，那么海明威的生命则简直太过**“美式”**。

他似乎全部都经历了——作为海钓冠军、迷惘的一代、军人、精神病患、拳击爱好人士、“普通的古巴人”，但或许最重要的，作为一个健美而强硬的男人，他以这个国家特有的浪漫主义式躁动的使命感，和贯彻自身正义的根深蒂固的自我中心，展现出一种被“行动”所塑造的哲学——和康德式沉思截然相反的思考模式。

在我的观念中，他是“迷惘的一代”不合格的代表。原因很简单，他根本就不迷茫，他很早就找到了英雄确定形式的表达。真正迷惘的，是他的朋友——具有梦想家气质的诗人——菲兹杰拉德，这种才华主要起源于天赐的敏感和忧郁。和菲兹对梦想不可及的憧憬不同，海明威的才华主要来源于对**理想**的崇拜；可以说，菲兹的文字是哀伤感的泄露，而海明威的文字是力量感的溢出。

应该说，我从未意识到作家可以以海明威的方式存在的可能性。我所钦慕的人们——毛姆、普鲁斯特、三岛由纪夫…，他们的文字无不成就于“对生活的拒绝”；而作为一个非常美式的作家， 海明威的文字则成就于“对生活的遍历”。换种方式说，海明威是稀有派的，以“行动”而非“想象力”来实践自身追寻的人。

但与其说我羡慕这种生存方式，不如说我深知这种生存方式和我自身气质有根本性的抵触。但毕竟我生活在他的故土呢，也许这个国家骨子里的实践主义会把我改造得面目全非也说不定。我对此也许也是张开双臂欢迎的。
