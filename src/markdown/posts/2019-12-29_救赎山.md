### (I) Unincorporated Territory
State Route 111 stretches leisurely along the eastern shore of the Salton Sea, where no speed limit signs exist, so all vehicles have switched to low-altitude flight mode, whooshing past the slow-moving freight trains in the distance. Through the starboard window, distant mountains dissolve into misty haze, while the enormous lake nearby exists with an unreal stillness—a mirage-like vision so real it's surreal, maintaining a measured distance from the road amid the unending wasteland scenery rolling beneath our wheels. Though it can hardly bear the magnificent beauty implied by the word "fairyland," it at least rivals some of the most ethereal products of imagination in its sheer incredibility.
Leaving the salt lake, the road flows languidly into Niland following its momentum, then suddenly seems to lose courage and turns due south, seeking the shortest route to escape this ashen land. Niland, and to its south Estelle, Verdant, Rockwood—these places are identified by Google Maps as "unincorporated areas," or the even more baffling "census-designated places"... Simply put, these obscure terms can be roughly understood as "lawless territories."
The car turns east, bidding farewell to gas stations without gas, then enters a cluster of town-like buildings. Under the dim yellow sun, not only human shadows but virtually all signs of life have been swept away by the dry, sandy winds. Yet surprisingly, the residential-looking houses glimpsed along the way have cars parked in their driveways that aren't dirty enough to appear abandoned; these subtle signs serve as perfect reminders not to let down your guard, for every shadow might harbor some cave-dwelling creature skilled at concealing its presence.
Crossing the railroad tracks, the town is abruptly cut off, and the vehicle suddenly enters another unknown territory. On both sides of the bumpy dirt road, countless power poles stand at equal intervals like the skeletons of gods. Even understanding that this area once served as an anti-aircraft artillery training base during World War II (thus explaining its developmental history), traveling through it still evokes a sense of "terminal journey"—like post-apocalyptic descendants returning to their ancestors' dead planet, where among the broken walls and ruins, only simple, grand religious installations become stubborn proof of humanity's former existence by refusing the passage of time.
Which is to say, they have never forgiven us.

### (II) Salvation Mountain
A small patch of color appears without warning. As the distance draws closer, this blob of color seems to defy the laws of perspective and refuse to grow, so upon approaching, the grandly named Salvation Mountain turns out to be merely a small mound-like protrusion, far from being a colossus.
First, it is not a miracle. Facing this hill I had long wanted to explore (perhaps even yearned for), intuitive revulsion makes me hesitate.
First, it is not a miracle! God should be a concept that transcends natural law, but this little hill is thoroughly "unnatural" in its existence. It exists so abruptly here: that pure, unadulterated paint collides and accumulates without disguise, shamelessly declaring: We never intended to be God—we are a festival of artifice.
Second, it is not a work of art either. Art describes life "as it should be," expressing ideals that transcend humanity. What I see in these aesthetically barren colors, however, is the creator's most faithful imitation of a delirious person—it doesn't rise above us; it is us, and obviously a pathologically enlarged, distorted version of us.
It is not a work of art! At the center of the mountain's belly, and everywhere else the eye can see, crooked slogans proclaiming "God is love" prominently display themselves—this is an absurd cult ritual, as if there exists such an infallible law in the world: that through tireless repetition, wishes can become truth.
No, repetitive chanting only makes one become one's own believer. The creator thinks he holds the key to salvation, but what he opens is the fanatical abyss named self.
Finally, this isn't even the fruit of demons. For demons would never mock humanity's misinterpretation of God's love in such a joyless manner.
On this hill, you see no flash of genius or inspiration; on the contrary, it all displays a kind of shoddy harmony between mass-produced painted objects.
Even demons would surely find it terrifyingly boring.

### (III) Leonard Knight
The creator of Salvation Mountain was named Leonard Knight, who at age 35 (1967) began reciting the Sinner's Prayer without warning in his car one day: "Jesus, I'm a sinner, please come upon my body and into my heart..." According to Salvation Mountain's official website, this was the day Jesus descended upon him. From then on, he devoted his whole body and heart to serving God, rushing to tell the churches in his hometown: Jesus has been misunderstood. The path to salvation is simple—accept Jesus, confess your sins; but the churches told him it wasn't that simple.
...It is that simple!
In 1970, he and other northern villagers looked up to see a hot air balloon fly over their small town, so he spent the next decade making a hot air balloon covered with the Sinner's Prayer and "God is love," intending to spread the path to salvation he firmly believed in. But the balloon never took flight—too big and too heavy. In 1984, he made his final failed attempt to launch it in Slab City. Before leaving this place of heartbreak, he decided to build a small sculpture as a memorial. For four years, he never managed to stop... but this little hill collapsed due to an unstable foundation.
Knight didn't lose heart. He repeatedly experimented until he developed a more stable mixture of clay and straw, then spent another decade or more at this site, which grew into the current (second) Salvation Mountain. During this time he also weathered some tug-of-war and setbacks with the government over paint pollution, plus the addition of a domed mud house (hogan) beside the mountain and a building Knight called a "museum"... this is the entirety of Salvation Mountain today.

### (IV) Looking Down from Above
Standing atop Salvation Mountain, the wind that rampages unrestrained across the plains actually chills one somewhat.
Having just emerged from this bizarre artificial creation and now looking down upon it from a superior position, I truly feel mixed emotions.
Yes, measured as a mountain, this object doesn't possess any remarkable scale; but if viewed as a painted sculpture, it displays breathtaking grandeur.
Similarly, by artistic standards, this mound lacks beauty and is hideously ugly; but from the perspective of pure effort and dedication, it extraordinarily demonstrates willpower far exceeding that of ordinary people.
I've always held this view: those who only mark time in place have no right to mock those who run with strange postures. Though Knight never received divine grace (he misread divine grace) like Van Gogh receiving revelation from the spirits, nothing embodies the human spirit more than his mountain-building persistence.
However, from another perspective, precisely because this persistence carries a kind of unrepentant foolishness and obstinacy, it makes him increasingly diverge from the divine and fall into heretical paths...
So, compared to those who create nothing at all, is Knight more worthy of celebration or more worthy of hatred?

### (V) The Visitors
As I walk on this mound with such conflicted feelings, the surroundings are filled with clamoring noise.
Groups of tourists pour out of private cars, seemingly eager to unfold their bodies after being curled up in seats for too long.
What unfolds along with them are their empty thoughts: that kind of void that can devour and assimilate everything, that kind of smugness that treats all things in the world as equivalent and takes deep pride in this.
Teacups and forests are the same thing, dental floss and rivers are the same thing, pebbles and the universe are also the same thing—everything that enters the eyes is the same thing.
Meanwhile, things the eyes cannot see do not exist.
I watch them call out to friends and pull out phones to take pictures, watch them clumsily climb the sculpture just to become the indisputable protagonist in crowded frames. I hear them pontificate in various dialects about things they don't understand at all, hear them casually use nutritionless phrases to dissolve the eerily divine yet demonic atmosphere that originally existed in this sacred space.
As long as we move in groups, we dare trample miracles, despise devils, and kill art.
What we call plague—isn't it precisely the bonds and seven emotions and six desires that people bring?
Hey Knight, this scene now makes your work become nothing at all.
Hey Knight, what do you fear most? Laughter? Mockery? Being forgotten?
No—it's this kind of misguided attention before our eyes.
Noahs, facing such animals, do you still want to build arks? (If I were Jesus, none of you would be saved)
But anyway, God is already dead.

### (VI) Slab City and Desert Artists
The place where Salvation Mountain stands is called Slab City. This is an area mainly composed of snowbird communities (referring to northerners who move to the warm south for winter) and a few permanent residents: mainly people who have become hermits due to poverty or a desire to escape modernity. This is Wikipedia's description.
But if you ask me, the actual situation looks somewhat different.
When entering the city along the vaguely discernible road (it's an unmarked plain, so theoretically any track that vehicles can drive becomes a road), there stands an unguarded guard booth by the roadside—this marks official entry into the territory (when leaving in the opposite direction, the other side of this booth reads "Caution: reality ahead").
Some very scattered RVs are parked in various places. From their weathered appearance, one seriously doubts whether the attribute of "vehicle" still exists. In any case, these shelter-like capsules mostly have stalls set up outside them. From a distance, they seem to be selling handmade tourist souvenirs (I stopped Ruoruo from getting out to look, as I always felt there might be something dangerous in this anarchistic suspicious atmosphere, so we only looked from afar).
Continuing forward, the "God is love" faith gradually mutates into "All you need is love" (a kind of blind worship and crude imitation riding on "trending topics"). The density of artificial objects grows ever greater, making it increasingly resemble a garbage dump.
Deeper into the heartland, the car finally turns left to reach the far northwest of the small city—the sculpture garden called "East Jesus." Here, functional houses, abandoned objects, and various assembled pieces serving as artworks finally reach a chaotic climax. They are placed everywhere, so they grow freely—like singing the wild songs of desperados in a feast of ruins!
You don't know how to define them.
But precisely because you don't know how to define them, you can name them "places where humans survive."

### (VII) Salton Sea and Sonoran Desert
Though this is clearly an inland desert, seagulls inexplicably fly at low altitude. This is magical.
A huge and beautiful lake stands quietly, but the surroundings are desolate, cities abandoned, seemingly inhabited only by the exiled. This is magical.
Only upon researching did I learn that the Salton Sea is not a natural lake; it was formed a century ago when torrential rains burst irrigation channels and flooded into the basin.
Half a century ago, this was California's most productive marine fishery area, home to diverse species, a waterfront tourist destination called "the miracle in the desert."
However, as lake water evaporated (low rainfall couldn't compensate), salinity increased; meanwhile, agricultural runoff containing pesticides and fertilizers also increased the lake's toxicity. Now this lake water is 25% saltier than the Pacific Ocean. The BBC calls this California's "nightmarishly vanishing sea."
Salvation Mountain, Slab City, Salton Sea... this truly is a magical land.

（一）非建制

111号州道沿着索尔顿湖（Salton Sea）东翼惬意伸展，这里没有任何限速标记，于是车辆全部开启了低空飞行模式，倏倏超过视野中缓慢移动的货运火车。右舷窗外，远山被氤氲的雾气离散得朦朦胧胧，而近处巨大的湖泊不真实地静静存在，以一种过于真实的蜃楼般的景象，在车轮下不间断延续的荒原景色中克制地与道路保持着咫尺的距离。它虽难以承担“仙境”一词的美轮美奂，却至少在不可思议的程度上可以匹敌某些最为虚幻的想象力。

离开盐湖，道路顺着惯性悠然淌进尼兰德，然后仿佛突然失却勇气似的径直折往正南方，为的是要以最短距离逃离这片灰烬般的土地。尼兰德（Niland），及其南方的埃斯特尔（Estelle）、弗丹特（Verdant）、罗克伍德（Rockwood），这些地点被谷歌地图识别为“非建制地区（unincorporated area）”，或更让人摸不着头脑的“普查规定居民点（census-designated place）”……简单来说，这些晦涩之词可以粗略理解为“法外之地”。

汽车向东一拐，告别没有油的加油站之后，就驶入了小镇模样的建筑群。昏黄的太阳下，岂止人影，简直连任何生命的迹象都被干燥的风沙刮走了。然而，出乎意料的是，沿途略过的住宅模样的房屋，廊前停放的轿车却并未肮脏到显出被废弃的模样；这隐隐约约的迹象恰到好处地提醒你不要放松警惕，因为每处阴影中也许都蛰伏着一种善于隐蔽气息的穴居生物。

而穿过铁轨，镇子被不由分说地拦截而下，车辆遽然进入下一片未知领域。颠簸的泥路两旁神明的骨架似的等距伫立着无数高压电杆。——就算理解了这片区域二战时曾作为防空炮兵的训练基地（于是因之有了被开发的历史），但切实在此间行进时，仍有某种“终末旅行”之感：如同末世后裔回到先民的死星，在断壁残桓之中，唯有简单宏大的宗教装置通过拒绝时间而死死成为人类曾经存活的明证。

也就是说，它们始终不曾原谅我们。



（二）救赎山

一小片色彩毫无征兆地出现。随着距离越来越接近，这团色彩却仿佛无视透视原理拒绝成长，于是临近一看，名号庄重的救赎山只是个与庞然大物相去甚远的小包状的突起。
首先，它不是一个神迹。面对这片我早想一探究竟（也许还心向往之）的山丘，直觉的反感却让我踟蹰不前。
首先，它不是一个神迹！神应当是某种超越自然之理的概念，但这匹小丘却彻底是“非自然”的存在。它是如此突兀地存在与此：那纯度极高的油漆不加掩饰地碰撞和堆砌，毫不愧怍地宣称，我们根本没想成为神——我们是人造物的盛典。

其次，它也不是一件艺术品。艺术描述“本应”的生活，表达超越人类的理念。而我在这些毫无美感的色彩中看到的，却是创作家对一个谵语者最忠实的临摹——它并没有高于我们，它就是我们，而且显然是病态的扩大的扭曲的我们。
它不是一件艺术品！山腹中央，以及其他目所能及的一切，都突出显现着“上帝是爱（God is love）”的歪斜标语——这是个荒诞的邪教仪式，仿佛世间存在这样一条不二法则：那就是通过不厌其烦的重复，愿望就可以变成真理。
不是的，反复的吟诵只会让人变成自己的信徒。创作者以为自己掌握了得救的钥匙，但他打开的却是名为自我的狂热深渊。

最后，这甚至不是恶魔的果实。因为恶魔永远不会以这种毫无乐趣的方式嘲笑人类对上帝之爱的曲解。
在这匹山丘上，你从中看不到任何天才或灵感的闪现，相反，它们整个显现出一种油漆物的量产品与量产品间粗制滥造的和谐。
一定就连恶魔也会觉得的太过可怕的无聊。



（三）伦纳德·奈特（Leonard Knight）

救赎山的创作者叫做伦纳德·奈特，他在35岁（1967年）的某天在自己的汽车中毫无征兆地开始吟诵起罪人祷告（Sinner's Prayer）：Jesus, I'm a sinner, please come upon my body and into my heart... 根据救赎山的官网介绍，这就是耶稣降临他身上的日子。自此以后，他全身全心侍奉上帝，他奔波于告知自己故乡的教堂：耶稣被误解了。得救之道很简单，接纳耶稣，忏悔罪恶；可是教堂告诉他说，事情没那么简单。

……事情就是那么简单！

1970年，他和其他北方村民抬头看到一个热气球飞过自家小镇，于是他花费接下来的10余年的时间制造一个写满罪人祷告和“上帝是爱”热气球，为的是宣扬他坚信不疑的得救之道。可是这气球终究没有升空，太大而太重。1984年，他在斯拉布城（Slab City）最后一次尝试放飞失败。在他离开这片伤心之地之前，他决定建一个小小的雕塑留下纪念，四年间，他始终没能停下来……然而这匹小丘因为底座不稳坍掉了。

奈特没有灰心，他反复试验出了一种更稳定的陶土和稻草混合物，然后他又在此地度过了10余年时光，这才长成了如今的（第二座）救赎山。其间又经历某些和政府关于涂料污染的拉锯和波折，加上山丘旁边添加的带穹顶的泥屋（hogan）和一座被奈特成为“博物馆”的建筑……就是这救赎山如今的全部。



（四）从上往下看

站在救赎山顶部，平原上毫无顾忌奔袭的风居然刮得人有些寒意。

刚刚从这座怪异的人造物中走出，又以一种居高临下的态度俯视它，我着实感到五味杂陈。

是的，以一匹山去衡量，这个物体并不具备什么了不起的规模；但若把它当做彩塑品来看，则显出令人咂舌的宏大。

同样，以艺术的标尺来观瞻，这座土丘毫无美感、丑陋不堪；但若从纯粹努力和专注的角度来说，则分外充分地体现了工匠远超常人的意志力量。

我一直怀以这样的观点，那就是只会原地踏步的人，没有资格嘲笑用怪异姿势跑步的人；奈特虽从未蒙受天恩（他误读了天恩）如梵高般领到神灵的启示，但没有什么比其造山般的坚持更能体现人类精神了。

然而，从另一方面来说，正因为这种坚持中带有一种不知悔改的愚莽和倔强，使得他愈发背离神祗而堕入邪道……

那么，比起什么都创造不出来的人，奈特是更加值得被庆贺还是更值得被痛恨呢？



（五）参观者们

当我带着这样的矛盾心情行走在这匹土丘上，周围却是噪声鼎沸。

一群群游客从私家车里涌出，似乎因长久地蜷倨于座位上而急于展开自己的身体。

随之展开的还有他们空洞的思想：那种可以吞噬和同化一切的虚空，那种将世间万物等量齐观并深以为此的自满。

茶杯和森林是一回事，牙线和河流是一回事，卵石和宇宙也是一回事，所有进入眼睛的东西都是一回事。

与此同时，眼睛看不到的东西都不存在。

我看着他们呼朋引伴地拿出手机拍照，看着他们笨拙地攀爬雕塑，就是为了能在人流熙攘的相框中成为无可争辩的主角。我听他们用各种方言对毫不理解的事物大放厥词，听他们轻描淡写地用毫无营养的字句消弭掉这个结界中本来存在的亦神亦鬼的怪诞空气。

只要我们成群结队，我们就敢践踏神迹，蔑视魔鬼，杀死艺术。

所谓瘟疫啊，难道不就是就是人们带来的羁绊和七情六欲吗？

我说奈特，如今这场景让你的作品变得什么都不是了。

我说奈特，你最怕的是什么呢？是大笑吗？是嘲讽吗？是遗忘吗？

不，是眼前这般不得要领的重视。

诺阿们，面对这样的动物，你们还想造船吗？（我要是耶稣，你们都别想得救）

但反正上帝都死了。



（六）斯拉布城和荒野艺术家

救赎山所在之地叫做斯拉布城。这是一片主要由候鸟群体（snowbird community，指冬季搬到温暖的南方居住的北方人）和少数永居者：主要是由于贫困或想要脱离现代性而离群索居的人构成。这是维基百科的介绍。

但如果要我说，实际情况看起来有些不同。

沿着隐隐约约的公路进城的时候（是没有任何标记的平原，所以理论上任何车辆能够驶出的轨迹都可以称之为公路），道旁立着一个没有人守卫的警卫亭，这就是正式进入地界了（反方向离开的时候，这个亭子的另一面写着“小心：前方现实 Caution: reality ahead”）。

一些非常分散的旅居车（RV）停靠各处，从它们饱经风霜的外表看起来，很让人怀疑“车”这个属性是否还继续存在。无论如何，这些庇护所模样的胶囊外大都展开一个个摊位，远远看去，似乎是在售卖手工制的旅游纪念品（若若想要下车看看，却被我制止住了，我总觉得这无政府主义的可疑气息中未尝不含有某种危险的东西，所以我们只是远远看去）。

继续向前，“上帝是爱”的信仰逐渐变种，成为“你只需要爱”（一种蹭“热点”的盲目崇拜和拙劣模仿）。人造物的密度越来越大，所以就越来越像一个垃圾场。

深入腹地，最终车子向左一拐，到达小城的极西北——却是被称作“东耶稣（East Jesus）”的雕塑园。在这里，功能性的房屋、废弃物还有承担着艺术品职能的一件件组合物件终于达到混乱的高潮，它们被随处放置，所以也就自由生长——宛如在遗迹的盛宴中吟唱亡命之徒的狂歌！

你不知道该怎么定义它们。

但正因为不知道怎么定义它们，你才能将其命名为“人存活的地方”。



（七）索尔顿湖和索诺兰沙漠

明明是一片内陆的荒漠，却莫名会低空飞过一些海鸥。这很魔幻。

一片巨大而美丽的湖泊静静矗立，但周遭荒凉，城市被废弃，似乎只有被放逐者的存在。这很魔幻。

查阅资料才知道，原来索尔顿湖并非天然湖泊；它是一个世纪前的暴雨冲垮了灌溉渠，涌入盆地形成的。

半世纪以前，这里还是加利福尼亚州最多产的海洋渔业产地，拥有多种生物，是被称为"沙漠中的奇迹"的滨水旅游胜地。

然而，随着湖水蒸发（低降雨量并不能弥补），湖水盐度升高；同时，含有农药和化肥成分的农业地表径流也增加了湖泊的毒性。如今这湖水的咸度比太平洋还高出 25%。BBC把这里称作加利福尼亚州“噩梦般消失的海”。

救赎山、斯拉布城、索尔顿湖……这实在是一片魔幻之地。

我脑海中一直闪过这些语句：淮左名都，竹西佳处。过春风十里，尽荠麦青青……
