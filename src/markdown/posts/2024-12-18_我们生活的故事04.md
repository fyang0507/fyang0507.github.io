**(Preface)**
The cherry trees along my commute have blossomed. But this is not early spring—it is early autumn.
Go ahead and bloom, I know that after the howling north wind subsides, you will still be fine.
But do not proclaim this: We bloom so early because we have foreseen spring from afar.
Spring will eventually come. It's just that before the thaw, some of your sisters will also perish in the bitter cold and wind and snow.
Please allow them to endure the winter with dignity.

**(I)**
In September, my college classmate came to New York. The first thing he said when we met was: "There aren't many people who can have lunch alone with me anymore. Do you know how much face you have now?" Then he mentioned his recent conversation with the helmsman of China's most famous venture capital firm in a high-rise private club overlooking Central Park, talking and laughing as equals.
(We've known each other for 13 years. After graduation, we rarely meet, and we usually discuss our ideals in brief, playful ways. In these exchanges, I sense our similarities and decisive differences in many aspects.)
I was genuinely happy for him. His genius and ideals perfectly align with his passion and the needs of the times, earning appreciation from those with resources—and this is not common. I pondered whether I had anything worth sharing, but these years I've only experienced the story of an ordinary employee watching leadership continuously pay the price for—and double down on—their mediocrity, arrogance, and narrow-mindedness (these three always march hand in hand).
So I thought, let's talk about robots instead.
During his PhD, he conceived a completely new paradigm for robot training. From my understanding, this framework essentially brings real life into simulated environments, thereby solving the problem of severely insufficient real-world data that often constrains training. At the same time, because this virtual environment is sufficiently diverse and realistic, the robot's capabilities won't be limited to specific tasks, thus achieving generalization.
He said he wants to establish an institution similar to early OpenAI that doesn't focus on short-term profits—at least in the near term, concentrating on breakthroughs in fundamental research. He went on to talk about Musk and Lego, saying he enjoys the feeling of building a model from scratch. I shared his excitement; I could hear how the puzzle has been taking shape bit by bit over these past few months.
Geopolitics cannot be ignored, but in the long term, the greater concern—and what's discussed more now, the outlook on AI's impact on social productivity—shares the same root: the ultimate question humanity must answer: What is a human being?
(In 2016, I wrote with feigned clarity: "The only thing in humanity that can withstand the test is not the timid moral and wisdom Tower of Babel they've spent millennia constructing, but the biological traits and conditioned reflexes imprinted in genetic material from the moment of birth." The following year, I smugly said: "Almost no one sees this fact clearly: humans are merely an intermediate link in the evolutionary spectrum, not the endpoint." But I was just a blind man then; I wanted to make shocking statements because I was angry about my life's circumstances.)
I asked him: How do you view the almost inevitable impact to come? Current social structures will never truly be prepared for this kind of thing.
He said: Whether the masses accept this reality or not, that door is destined to be pushed open. Rather than let others do it, why not me?

I recalled many similar words.
I remembered Kobe saying in an interview: (In the game) Someone's going to win, so why not me?
I remembered when Musk was asked if he had many concerns when founding SpaceX, he was silent for a long time, then said: Fuck that, let's get it done.[1]
Perhaps pioneers are like this—grand ideals, but actions that are pure, unencumbered by reality's drag. "With bright eyes singing high, looking at my son; with a red heart working hard, managing the motherfucker."[2]
I admire them, but I want to become a different kind of person. The kind who dedicates himself to bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and ordinary people, who doesn't want the locomotive to just accelerate day and night without rest, nor wants the people in the carriages to think that 1g of gravity is all there is to the world...
I wants to help these two worlds see each other, I wants them to understand each other's circumstances a little.

**(II)**
This might be a form of escape. I often think about things that are fundamentally not mine to consider: humanity's fate, the people's fate, culture's fate. I used to think their improvement was mutually reinforcing, but when I look at history from a more detailed perspective, I realize that except for a few sweet periods, these three often conflict with each other. And now I feel suffocated, because although it's not quite "ten thousand horses standing mute," all three seem to have entered a gradually narrowing cave: the deeper one goes, the harder progress becomes; and the fire is almost out.
This doesn't mean our era is particularly terrible—it just has enormous stability and enormous inertia. Before suddenly breaking free, it runs along a track that's bad but not so bad, slowly, slowly approaching a deep pit. This is easy to understand and convenient to endure. The world has been peaceful for so long that even though we know certain places have been turned upside down, since it hasn't collapsed on our own heads, we can still act as if nothing has happened.
I remember being suddenly surrounded by a group of happy people in a windmill village, asking if I'd be willing to take photos with them. They were playing a family game: finding people on a list in the scenic area, and with a camera hanging around my neck, I was mistaken for a photographer. Everyone smiled happily in the photo, and these smiles had nothing to do with Europe's darkened fate after the Nord Stream explosion.
I remember seeing an Israeli flag hanging from the third floor of an apartment building in Amsterdam, while the tenant above hung a Palestinian flag of the same size. The Gaza conflict had been going on for a year, everyone had passionate positions about it, but pedestrians on the street still sat calmly in coffee shops, unperturbed.
I remember the World War II memorial documenting how, after the city's liberation, Dutch girls who had relationships with German soldiers were paraded through the streets with their heads shaved. Some of them protested: "I was in my prime, I was just looking for love! Besides, he was more considerate than the Dutch men..."
It's easy to want to be blind; modern life offers many convenient means to obtain small but immediate, anesthetic-like happiness. But I insist on being a seeing person. I say this because I feel restless. The more powerless I am, the more I want to shout like those mistresses:
In such a time in history's cycle, I am actually young and strong!...[3]

**(III)**
Two years ago, during the career planning session of employee reviews, I was hesitant and deferential. I looked at my bosses' promotion trajectories, I drew inspiration from industry thought leaders' speeches, I seriously considered what projects I could do and what impact I could bring to the company. But now I know all that stuff is bullshit. I do excellent work and get good performance reviews, but no budget means no budget.
Actually, I understood from the beginning of my career that I was stepping into the afterglow of the golden decade of internet tech companies. I watched the people ahead of me eating meat. I drank the meat-flavored soup from blanching water. I envied and resented. But looking at the juniors who couldn't even get soup, I felt fortunate.
Now those people who became smooth-talking from gorging themselves tell me that while they'll keep eating meat as usual, there's not enough soup to go around.
Looking at the juniors, I can't bear to smash this bowl in my hands; looking at the seniors, I can't swallow this bland soup.
I could blame this on the era's mistakes, but that would only further highlight the thorough vulgarity and compromise of a middle-class person.
This spring, I saw an article in my social media feed about "How to Get Through History's Garbage Time"[4]. This phrase sparked extensive discussion and silencing during the summer. I said I agreed with it, not because I could verify its claimed economic foundations or historically indisputable repeatability, but because it empathized with my feelings, it gave me an excuse to lie flat, and the despair I read in it was precisely my own despair when facing my powerlessness and cowardice.

**(IV)**
At the beginning of the year, I started looking through the image collection "Our Generation"[5]. These are portraits of China's literary and artistic circles from the 80s and 90s, featuring people we're familiar with, who are even still active in the arts today: Cui Jian, Zhang Yimou, Gu Cheng, Yu Hua, Sanmao... I was interested in this collection because I was curious about the stories China experienced during those years of reform and opening up. I'd seen plenty of historical facts, economic figures, policies, entrepreneurs, but here were living people, their lives, and after all, literature and art should represent living people...
Before reading this book, I had already corrected some of my short-sighted views. In early years, I thought "people in the arts" were a very different group, that the arts industry was a special industry, but that's not the case. The arts world also has political struggles, power transitions, nepotism; and because of its insularity, these things only proliferate more brazenly than in other industries.
But reform and opening up was such a unique sample. In that time window, old forces were shattered, new things grew in lawless lands, and the power structures of these lawless lands were still waiting to take shape (it's like America's successive waves of immigration, and somewhat like today's AI)...
China's modern art, like China's private enterprises, appears to have had a rough and gray birth. They weren't competing with existing crops for farmland, but mainly facing barren soil. They needed sharp teeth, they needed to disregard boundaries, to chew nutrition from this harsh soil. But once they could get down into those wells, once they adapted to opening their eyes in that environment, they could find infinite ideas there, because fundamentally, in the process of creating something from nothing, nothing is forbidden.
I know that was a golden age, I know that miraculous growth rate enriched people by how much in the blink of an eye. But I don't know if I should envy them, and I don't know if I could have made my mark in that era.
Like that day when I was visiting a church, arrow-like rays of light shot down from some opening. Standing in that dazzling sunlight, I felt the surrounding air floating weightlessly, trying to fill this vast emptiness. Then Jesus's statue descended from the dome, blocking that patch of light, and the interior became clear. I could breathe, and looking at that huge cross silhouette illuminated by light, I suddenly understood why self-imposed faith can also bring peace of mind.
I've stayed too long in discipline; freed from order, I don't feel liberated wings but like a lone, soaked chick.
But even so, I actually think I've been doing pretty well all along.

**(V)**
In my memory, during some high school Chinese tutoring class, I saw the teacher write on the blackboard:
Life - Net.[6]
I was intoxicated by this one-character short poem. But not the intoxication of finishing fine wine, but the breathlessness of being choked while swallowing whole. That was the premature imagination of a boy whose desires had matured early when life had just begun to lift her veil for me. (This often happens—we encounter naked truth very early, but only realize many years later that those various shadows wandering the streets were all the different clothes it had worn.)
Foucault let me see the net. What is a net? A net is another name for power.
In Foucault's theory, the fear of darkness and opacity during the French Revolution prompted people to dream of a society with "unobstructed vision, where public views are mutually visible." This society fundamentally prevents crime because "by placing people in completely visible spaces, their views, thoughts, and words about others can avoid leading to harmful behaviors." This utopian vision, spreading from schools, barracks, hospitals, and police stations that could establish tracking records, gradually formed a modern society with "panopticon"-like panoramic transparency, where everyone assumes they're being monitored and consciously becomes a monitor, so "power is implemented most widely at increasingly smaller cost."[7]
This theory deeply moves me—it illuminates many historical contexts and social phenomena, but it brings no hope at all. Foucault says "individuals are vehicles of power, not points where power is applied," which seems to comfort me by saying that as a conduit of power, I shouldn't have any emotions, just as soil and riverbeds don't have emotions when rainwater seeps through soil and flows through them.
Power is abstract, but life is the opposite. I can count many specific people who can drastically affect my fate. I also truly know that my life circumstances are completely outside their sight or concern.
When I see "net" now, I don't think about how power flows, don't think about systemic rules, scientific tyranny, moral discipline—I think of a moth wrapped tighter and tighter in spider silk, fluttering.

**(VI)**
Along the main canal in Antwerp, there's a particularly interesting "Red Star Line" museum. This museum was converted from warehouses, customs, and quarantine facilities. A century ago, people here disinfected luggage, bathed, and passed American doctors' physical examinations before boarding ships to the New World. The Red Star Line was the first commercial passenger route from the European continent to North America. From its establishment in 1873 until its bankruptcy during the Great Depression, it carried over two million passengers to North America, many of whom were immigrants fleeing war, Nazis, and seeking their fortune in the New World: Einstein was among them.[8]
At the time, if an ordinary European family wanted to immigrate, they would first send the most adventurous member of the family to North America. After he established himself and accumulated savings, he would bring other members over in batches. These advance scouts sent colorful postcards back to the Old World: magnificent Niagara, bustling New York, crowded Atlantic City—or simply purchased ship tickets.
These postcards proclaimed a dream: in the eyes of proactive and enterprising pioneers, America was a fairyland! But the speculators who arrived early hid the reality in the second half of that sentence: America is a fairyland! An extremely dangerous fairyland...
I believe not all passengers felt fortunate to have participated in the voyage, but the fact is, without the Red Star Line, America wouldn't have had the Manhattan Project, and Europe wouldn't have had cheap vacuum cleaners, Playboy, and the Atlantic Community. The Red Star Line wasn't just a transportation tool, nor was it limited to all the dignity and humiliation, hopes and attachments, timidity and determination of the passengers on board. The Red Star Line connected two continents—though not in the best way for both sides, but connected nonetheless.
Nations, politics, culture, AI all need communication, just as people need communication! In the preface to "Our Generation," it says: Everything in human society is merely context for each other. With longing for such an era, I wrote in the exhibition's final comment section:
May the Red Star truly connect the world.

**(VII)**
Starting in summer, I spent four full months reading Ehrenburg's memoir: "People, Years, Life"[9].
This book already has 1.38 million words, but I still feel its density is too great. As a reflection of nearly a century of history, too many emotions and times can only be highly compressed into a few brief words. We say "Cold War"—these are two light words, but they mean many people lived most of their lives in that heavy atmosphere.
I could say too much praise about this book. I'm impressed by the author's vast knowledge, his "minimum program," his honesty about confusion, his persistent enthusiasm and courage in harboring ideals, but what's most moving is that heart. As the author said when evaluating Lenin: "Rare modesty, strength, and determination—determination that neither excludes gentleness nor denies deep respect for spiritual wealth, for reason, for art—this is humanitarianism, true humanitarianism."
Conscience is also just two words. Different eras will make different demands on us, but practicing conscience always means abundant strength and abundant love. This strength and love isn't for influencing history's course, isn't for standing oneself like a scale mark on the timeline, but for breaking through the curtain of indifference, for letting people of the same era and different eras encounter each other, for letting others be infected with hope.
For the same reason, after watching "Good Stuff," I understood "upright, brave, and read a lot" as a satirical phrase. This describes how China's relatively least constrained by tradition, most free in thought, insight, and economic foundation group of people have devoted all their energy to elegant living and caring for themselves. People choose to reconcile with visible life, but don't struggle with larger "structural problems." This is typical "American Dream" narrative: at the end of personalized experience is blindness to the individual's responsibility in society. Lacking action, lacking perspectives that encompass others—shouldn't say "what do I have to pity," but should ask "what can I help people more pitiful than me."
But I have no standing to criticize, because I myself am the object of satire. I wrote a long piece of text just to declare for myself: I'm in a bad situation, but I fucking read a lot!

（序）

我通勤路上的几束樱树开花了。但这不是早春，而是初秋时候的事情。
你们尽管开好了，我知道在那呼呼的北风停歇之后，你们仍然会好好的。
但不要这样宣扬：我们开得这样早，是因为我们远远就预判了春天。

春天最终会来的。只是在解冻之前，你们的一些姊妹也会在严寒和风雪中死去。
请允许它们有尊严地捱过冬天吧。



（一）

9月的时候，我的大学同学来纽约。见面时他第一句话就说：能单独和我吃午饭的人不多了，你知道你现在面子有多大吗？然后他就提起他前日和中国最著名的风投机构的掌舵人在面朝中央公园的高层私人会所中谈笑风生的事。

（我俩认识13年了，毕业之后我们不常见面，也通常以戏谑的方式简洁地谈起理想；在这种交流中我感到我们在很多方面的相似和决定性的不同。）

我真正为他感到高兴，他的天才和理想正好对应上他的热情和时代的需要、能为有资源的人所赏识，而这不是常见的。我思索了一下自己是否有什么值得分享，但这些年我所经历的只是一个普通职员看到领导层为自己的庸碌、自负和狭隘（这三者总是携手前行）不断付出代价和变本加厉的故事。

于是我想，那我们还是说回机器人吧。

他在博士期间构想了一套关于机器人训练的全新范式，在我的理解中，这套框架大致是将现实生活搬入模拟的环境，这样就得以解决训练中经常被掣肘的现实数据严重不足的问题；同时，因为这个虚拟环境是足够多样、逼真的，因此机器人的能力就不会被限制于特定任务，从而实现一般化。

他说，他想创立的是一个类似早年OpenAI的不注重短期盈利的机构，至少在近期，专注于底层研究的突破。他接着说起马斯克和乐高，说他喜欢从无到有地垒砌一个模型的感觉。我和他一起兴奋，我能听到这几个月以来，拼图在一点点成型。

地缘政治是无法忽视的，但在远景上，更大的担忧和如今被讨论得更多的——AI对社会生产力的影响的展望——同根同源，那是人类必须回答的终极问题：人是什么？

（我在2016年故作清醒地写道：“人类唯一能经得住考验的东西，并不是他们花费千年的精力堆积起来的臆病的道德、智慧的巴别塔，而是在诞生之初就刻印在遗传物质中的生物性状和条件反射。”，后一年，我又沾沾自喜地说：“几乎没有人看清这个事实：人类仅仅是进化图谱上的中间一环而非终点。”但那时我只是个瞎子，我想语出惊人，是因为对自己生活的状况感到愤怒。）

我问他，你对几乎必然到来的冲击怎么看？现在的社会结构对这种东西可没有真正准备好的一天。

他说，无论大众是否接受这个现实，那扇门注定是要被推开的；与其让别人来，不如我自己来。

我想起来很多相似的话。

我想起科比采访时说：（比赛中）总会一方会赢的，那为什么不是我呢？

我想起马斯克被问到创立SpaceX的时候有没有许多担心的时候沉默许久，然后说：去他的，让我们来搞定他。[1]

开拓者也许就是这样的，理想宏大，行动则是不受现实拖拽的纯粹。青眼高歌望吾子，红心大干管他妈。[2]

我欣赏他们，但我想成为另一种人。那种人致力于弥合前沿研究和普通大众的差异，他不希望火车头只是没日没夜地加速，也不希望车厢里的人认为1g的重力就是世界的全部……

他想努力让这两个世界相互看见，他想让他们稍微理解彼此的处境。



（二）

这也许是一种逃离。我常常思考一些根本轮不上我考虑的事情：人类的命运，人民的命运，文化的命运。我以前总以为，它们的改善相辅相成；但当我从更细节处看历史，我才知道，除了少数的甜蜜时期，这三者经常相互抵触。而如今我感到窒息，因为虽不至于万马齐喑，这三样事倒都像走入了一个逐渐收窄的山洞：入之愈深，其进愈难；而火且尽。

这并不是说我们的时代有多么糟糕，它只是有巨大的稳定和巨大的惯性，在突然脱缰之前，绕着糟糕但又没有那么糟糕轨道运行，慢慢地、慢慢地接近一个深坑。这是易于理解和便于忍受的。这个世界和平了那么久，所以哪怕我们知道某些地方已经天翻地覆，但既然没有倾覆到自己头上，也就还可以当做无事发生。

我想起我在风车村突然被一群快乐的人团团围住，问我是否愿意和他们合照。他们正进行一场家庭游戏：在景区找到列表中的人；而我脖子上挂着相机，就被当成了摄影师。照片里大家开心地笑，这些笑容和北溪爆炸后命运黯淡的欧洲没有一点关系。

我想起阿姆斯特丹一栋公寓的三楼挂出了以色列的国旗，而它楼上的住户以同样的尺寸挂着巴勒斯坦的。加沙的冲突已经过去一年，大家对此都有激烈的主张，但街上行人还是波澜不惊地坐在咖啡店里。

我想起二战纪念馆中记载城市解放后，和德国士兵相好的荷兰姑娘们被剃光头发游街示众的场景。她们中有人辩解：我正值芳龄，只是想寻找爱情啊。况且他比荷兰的男人们还要体贴……

想要当个盲人很容易，现代化的生活中有很多方便的手段获取渺小但及时的、麻醉药似的幸福。可我偏要当个见人。我这么说是因为我感到骚动。我越是无能为力，越是想像那些情妇们一样大喊：

在历史周期的这样一个时间里，我居然年轻力壮！…… [3]



（三）

两年以前，在员工评审的职业规划环节，我唯唯诺诺。我看着我老板们的晋升轨迹，我从行业意见领袖的发言中获取灵感，我认真思考我能做什么项目，能给公司带来什么影响。但现在我知道这些东西都是狗屁。我完成很好的工作，得到良好的绩效，但没有预算就是没有预算。

其实我从入行就明白，我踩在了互联网科技公司黄金十年的余晖里。我看到前面的人吃肉。我喝那些焯水的有肉味儿的汤。我羡慕和怨愤。但是看着那些连汤也喝不到的后辈，我又感到侥幸。

现在那些因为大快朵颐而油嘴滑舌的人告诉我说，肉尽管要照常吃，但汤不够分了。

看着后辈，我舍不得砸下这手里的碗；望着前辈，我咽不下这寡淡的汤。

我尽可以推说这是时代的错误，但只能更加彰显一个中产阶级彻头彻尾的卑俗而妥协。

今年春天，我在朋友圈看到了“如何度过历史的垃圾时间” [4] 的文章，这个说法在夏天的时候引发过大量讨论和噤声。我说我认同它，并不是因为我能验证它自称的经济学的根基或历史层面无可争议的重复性，而是它能共情我的感受，它给了我躺平的借口，而我从中读到的绝望正是我面对自身无力和怯懦时本身的绝望。



（四）

年初的时候，我开始翻看《我们这一代》[5] 的影像集。这是些关于中国80，90年代的文艺届肖像，书中的人物是我们所熟悉的，甚至至今仍然在文艺界活跃的：崔健，张艺谋，顾城，余华，三毛……我对这册集子感兴趣，是因为我好奇中国改革开放那些年经历的故事。我看到过不少史实，经济数字，政策，企业家，但这里是活生生的人，是他们的生活，况且文艺本身就应该表现活生生的人……

在看这本书之前，我已纠正过自己的一些短见。早年我曾以为，“搞文艺的”是一群很不一样的人，文艺行业是一个特别的行业，但并不是这样。文艺界也存在政治斗争，权力交替，裙带关系；甚至因为其封闭性，它们只会比在其他行业里更加肆无忌惮地繁殖。

但改革开放是这样一个独特的样本，在那个时间窗口里，旧的势力被打碎了，新的东西又生长在法外之地，而法外之地的权力结构还在等待成型（它像美国历次的移民潮，也有些像如今的AI）……

中国的现代艺术看上去和中国的民营企业一样，出生是草莽和灰色的。他们不是在和已有的作物争夺田地，而主要是面对一片荒土。他们要有锋利的牙口，他们要不顾那些界桩，才能从这些尖锐的土壤中嚼出营养来。但一旦能下到那些井下去，一旦他们适应在那种环境中睁开眼，他们就能从中找到无限的思想，因为从根本上说，从无到有的过程里就是不禁止任何事情发生。

我知道那是黄金时代，我知道那奇迹般的增长率让人们倏忽间富足了多少。可我不知道我是否应该羡慕他们，我也不知道我在那个年代能否大展身手。

就像那天我在一座教堂里面参观，利箭一样的光线从某处的开口射下。我身处那令人目眩的日光中，只觉得周围空气失重地飘浮，力图填满这空旷的虚无。这时耶稣的雕像从穹顶降落，他挡住了那片光，于是室内变得清晰起来。我变得可以张口呼吸，我望着那个被光打亮的巨大十字剪影，突然明白作茧自缚的信仰为什么也能让人心安。

我在规训中呆得太久了，脱离了秩序我不是感到被解放了翅膀而是像一只落单的淋湿的小鸡。

但就算这样我居然觉得自己一直过得不错。



（五）

记忆中，高中某节语文课外班里，我看到老师在黑板上写下：

生活 网。[6]

我为这一个字的短诗陶醉了。但不是饮罢佳酿的陶醉，而是囫囵吞枣时被噎住的短气。那是生活刚刚向我揭开她的面纱时愿望早熟的少年的想象。（时常有这样的事，我们和赤裸的真理很早打上照面，但很多年后才反应过来，那许多在街上到处溜达的影子，原来都是它披过的各式的外衣。）

福柯让我看见了网。什么是网？网是权力的别名。

在福柯的理论中，法国大革命时期对黑暗和不透明的恐惧，促使人们梦想一个“视觉不受任何阻碍，公众的观点相互可见”的社会，这个社会从根本上避免犯罪，因为“通过把人置于完全可视的空间，这样他们的观点、思考和有关他人的话语就可以避免导致有害的行为”。这乌托邦式构想，从可以建立追溯档案的学校、兵营、医院、警察局扩散开来，逐渐形成“圆形监狱”似的全景式透明的现代社会，每个人都默认自己被监视，也自觉地成为监视者，于是“权力以越来越小的代价得到最广泛的实施”。 [7]

这套理论很打动我，它阐明了很多历史脉络和社会现象，但就是不带给人任何希望。福柯说“个人是权力的运载工具，而不是权力的作用点”，这似乎是在宽慰我说，作为一个权力的通道，我犯不上产生什么情绪，就像雨水渗入泥土流经河床的时候，泥土和河床不会产生任何情绪一样。

权力是抽象的，但生活与此相反，我能数出来很多能剧烈影响我命途的具体的人。我也确实知道我的生活境况如何根本不在他们的视距或关心之内。

我现在看到“网”的时候，我不是在想权力如何流通，不是想系统法则、科学专制、道德规训，我想到的是一只被蛛丝裹得越来越紧的扑棱的蛾子。



（六）

安特卫普主运河沿岸有个特别有意思的“红星号”博物馆。这个博物馆由仓库、海关和检疫所改建而成。一个世纪以前，人们在这里消毒行李，洗澡和通过美国医生的身体检查，然后登船前往新大陆。红星号是欧洲大陆通向北美的第一条商业客运航线，从1873年建立到大萧条时破产，它一共运载了两百多万乘客到达北美，这些乘客中相当部分是躲避战乱、纳粹以及去新大陆碰运气的移民：爱因斯坦也是其中之一。[8]

当时，如果一个普通欧洲家庭想要移民，他们会先派出家族内最具冒险精神的人前往北美。在他站稳脚跟并拥有积蓄后，再将成员分批接过去。这些先遣者向旧大陆寄来五颜六色的明信片：壮丽的尼亚加拉、车水马龙的纽约、人流熙熙的大西洋城——或者干脆就是买好的船票。

这些明信片嚷嚷着一个梦想：在具有主动和进取精神的拓荒者眼里，美国就是仙境！但提前抵达的投机者把后面那句现实藏住不说：美国是仙境！是极其危险的仙境……

我相信不是所有乘客都对他们参与了航行感到庆幸，但事实就是，如果没有红星号，美国就没有曼哈顿计划，而欧洲就不会有廉价吸尘器、花花公子和大西洋共同体。红星号并不只是一个运载工具，也并不局限于船上乘客的所有尊严与屈辱，希冀与眷恋，畏缩与决绝。红星号将两个大陆联结在一起——尽管不是以对双方都最好的方式，但毕竟还是联结在一起。

国家、政治、文化、AI都需要沟通，就像人需要沟通一样！《我们这一代》序言中写道：人类社会的一切，不过互为语境。我怀着对这种时代的憧憬，在展览最后的留言区写下：

愿红星能真正地连结世界。



（七）

从夏天开始，我用满四个月的时间读完爱伦堡的回忆录：《人，岁月，生活》[9]。

这册书已经有138万字，但我仍然觉得它密度太大。作为对近一个世纪的历史的反映，太多情感和时间只能被高度压缩成聊聊数语。我们说“冷战”，这是轻巧的两个字，但它意味着许多人在那种沉重氛围中活过的大半辈子。

我可以对这本书说太多赞美，我折服于作者的博闻强识，他的“最低纲领派”，他对迷惘的坦诚，他怀揣理想的持之以恒的热忱和勇气，但最让人感动的是那颗心。就像作者在评价列宁时说：“罕见的谦虚、力量以及决心，这种决心既不排除温和，也不否定对精神财富、对理性、对艺术深深的尊敬，——这才是人道精神，真正的人道精神。“

良心也只有两个字。不同时代对我们会提出不同的要求，但践行良心始终意味着丰沛的力量和丰沛的爱。这些力量和爱不是为了左右历史的进程，不是为了把自己像刻度一样立在时间轴上，而是为了突破漠不关心的帷幔，为了让同时代和不同时代的人打上照面，为了让他人感染希望。

出于相同原因，在看完《好东西》后，我把“正直勇敢有阅读量”理解为一句讽刺的话。这是说中国相对被传统限制最少，思想见识和经济基础都最为自由的一类人把所有心思都用在了优雅生活和关心自己上。人们选择和看得见的生活做和解，但不和更大的“结构性问题”做抗争。这是典型的“美国梦”式叙事：在个人化经历的尽头是对个体在社会上担任的职责的视而不见。缺乏行动、缺乏囊括他人的视角——不应该讲“我有什么可怜的”，而应该问“我能帮到比我可怜的人什么”。

但我没有任何立场批评，因为我自己就是被讽刺的对象。我写了一大篇文字就是在为自己声明：我处境不佳，但我有他妈的阅读量！
