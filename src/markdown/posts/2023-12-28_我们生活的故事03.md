**(Preface I)**
The scorching noon finally passes  
We wait  
For the sky-spanning sunset  
That should rightfully compensate us  
But just like that, by coincidence  
The sky suddenly darkens in an instant  

To hibernate would be fortunate  
Otherwise you'll be like me  
Staying awake on the sandbar  
Until you've witnessed the entirety  
Of this unsettling eclipse  

**(Preface II)**
It was only two or three years ago, when I finally broke free from the cocoon of excessive self-consciousness and was first struck by the diversity of the world and history, that I came to realize the essence of human society is actually a form of narrative.
The following year, as I simultaneously listened to the unguarded propaganda and deafening silence from two opposing hilltops, I discovered that differences in narrative approaches could be completely dissolved by a more neutral, more monotonous perspective that "everyone is the same."
And now, as our generation of mayflies stands at the forefront before the wheels of history, I finally see this truth clearly: in days that are neither too good nor too bad but are getting progressively worse, facing the intractable afflictions of mixed capitalist society, hereditary authority, and technological optimism, maintaining conscience and basic clarity has become an obvious curse.
But even so, don't let the pastoral deceive you.
Don't let life deceive you either [1].

**(I)**
Out of a vague restlessness to help others, I downloaded the Be My Eyes app on my phone. Before this app integrated GPT-4, it would broadcast requests from visually impaired people to volunteers on the platform, and volunteers would use video calls to assist with tasks that posed challenges for the requesters: things like finding directions, reading text, identifying objects, and so on.
The only call I've received so far came one evening. When connected, the video showed a shaky image revealing black leather shoes and plastic bags hanging from someone's hand.
I called into the phone, "What kind of help do you need?" Then the camera turned toward a two-way street that looked like a misty morning in a residential area. The voice on the other end said, "Help me see if there are any cars, I want to cross the street." Even though there was no crosswalk.
Before I could respond, he began moving forward. At that moment the camera caught a sedan approaching, and I shouted, "Stop! There's a car!"
But before I finished speaking, the camera confidently stopped shaking. The voice on the other end murmured, "I see it." Then he walked across the first half in just a few steps. Now the traffic was flowing in the opposite direction, but the phone's perspective hadn't changed. I said, "Quick, use your phone to check the right side!" But he had already stepped up onto the curb and reached the sidewalk. My task was complete.
The voice on the other end thanked me, then the screen disconnected and jumped to the app's congratulations interface. It thanked me very much for my help.
Even though I hadn't helped with anything at all.
But I won't forget how my entire body trembled after hanging up that call. It was a rarely experienced feeling of excitement, as if I had done something remarkable. And after that excitement wore off, a massive and exhausting sense of satisfaction came flooding over me like a tidal wave. My rational mind perceived that benevolent trap, but my body honestly went limp, as if I were someone who had just been pulled from hell and found salvation.

**(II)**
Medieval times had indulgences, and modern people can volunteer.
Volunteer work is sometimes exactly such a trap, in which we nourish our hypocritical empathy with precisely timed, packaged goodwill—and then it can go on living with a straightforward, guilt-free conscience!
So I really don't know whether those people who take private jets yet shout about taking global change seriously, those whose refrigerators are managed by staff yet distribute food to refugees, those who are surrounded by subordinates while visiting the shacks of sanitation workers—when they engage in these "public welfare activities," do they sincerely feel they're contributing to humanity, or at least feel justified about the power and wealth they rest upon. Because I can testify from personal experience that purifying the soul hardly requires any grand endeavor, and though I pride myself on being level-headed, I too can feel noble based on one trivial little thing.
And they—they've paid a greater price, endured more grievances (their shining dresses and crisp suits have touched our vulgar dust), so they deserve an even more soul-penetrating reward for their social contributions!
When the poor are trapped in life's endless whirlpool, there are always some people who can successfully convert even the guilt seeping from their remaining conscience into rewards for themselves through condescending benevolence.
This is a cunning form of moral money laundering, and no wonder the happiness of the rich is beyond our imagination.
I have reason to remain vigilant about this feeling, and I have reason to remain vigilant about the personality this feeling produces.

**(III)**
When I was in London, I visited Daido Moriyama's career retrospective exhibition curated by The Photographers' Gallery. Five floors of exhibition space from top to bottom were filled with Moriyama's signature high-contrast, coarse-grained, powerfully impactful black and white photographs.
He has been shooting this way for more than half a century. After William Klein, he has almost become the representative of black and white street photography style. From Hawaii to New York to Buenos Aires, and of course mostly Tokyo's Shinjuku, his creative career spans numerous works, having even published essays and interview collections; rather than calling him a photographer, he almost represents a photographic language or cultural phenomenon.
Looking at these emotionally intense photographs, my feelings were complex.
I thought, how can he spend a lifetime taking such similar photographs?

I've been thinking recently about the issue of "deliberateness" and "growth" in artistic creation—any artist in any field will inevitably encounter creative bottlenecks. How one responds to such frustrating moments determines the trajectory of an artist's career.
Moriyama advised students that "when you're at a complete loss, be like a sea cucumber sleeping curled up on the ocean floor, but one morning you'll suddenly want to move" [2], though his inner experience during bottleneck periods was much more painful and bewildering than this phrase suggests. Fortunately, after years of struggle, he continued his style of being a "witness to humanity's history of victimization," shooting this way for more than half a century. He eventually became an evergreen in the photography world, not just a flash-in-the-pan provocative Japanese photographer (though that would already be quite remarkable).
From a photography history perspective, Moriyama's consistent shooting approach and career longevity helped him go further; but from another angle, his stability could also be called narrow (stopping short of exploring new artistic possibilities), lazy (staying in his comfort zone without trying new forms of expression), or deliberate (following past success patterns for replication and mass production). Even though Moriyama's self-accounts are incredibly sincere, I still cannot distinguish whether the creative impulse when he presses the shutter is a unique natural response of individual intuition in each unrepeatable moment, or a conditioned reflex built up by his nervous system through repeated creation.

**(IV)**
Conceptually, the art I most admire should be "natural," meaning the creative motivation comes entirely from spontaneity, and the creative method follows the creator's unique personal aesthetics—that is to say, from a fatalistic perspective, the production of this work is the "inevitable necessity" [3] among continuous coincidences in life. Once an artwork's completion comes from deliberately sought inspiration or experimentally developed technical styles, I feel it hasn't reached perfection.
Similarly, Chinese philosophy often avoids deliberateness.

Hongren passed the Zen patriarch's robe and bowl to Huineng, who wrote "Originally there is nothing, where can dust settle," rather than to Shenxiu, who wrote "Constantly wipe and clean, let no dust settle" (not deliberately practicing the Way); Zhuangzi had his theory of "the sage having no self" (not deliberately distinguishing); and though Confucianism is the most worldly, when faced with Yang Huo's request for him to take office, Confucius's first reaction was also to avoid it (not deliberately seeking). On the point of "acting without action yet achieving everything," the three teachings of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism have never disagreed.
Feng Youlan said that "epistemology has never developed in Chinese philosophy" because Chinese philosophy is built on the foundation of nature, common sense, and intuition, rather than logical deduction: the concepts of Chinese philosophy almost come from direct insight [4].
And the undertone of this insight is pessimistic. Because "man can conquer nature" is not a principle that can be verified under general historical conditions. Facing the unpredictability of the future, more common thoughts are "accepting fate" or "avoiding harm."
Contrary to the views of those vested interests, lying flat is not a betrayal of history, but a return to history. We can indeed say that contemporary young people have implemented the essence of Confucian thought: that is, living earnestly and honestly, beginning with action-oriented understanding.

So what is "knowledge-oriented action"?
It's the investment managers who talk about how important moats are but can't resist shorting when growth rates slow down.
It's the show-offs who put on a relaxed demeanor but turn city walks into fashion shows.
You see, it's precisely these dishonest actions that make the world truly as bad as we expected.

Oppose pretentiousness
Oppose superficiality

**(VI)**
On a day in mid-May, when I went downstairs to buy fried dough sticks, delivery workers from Ele.me began gathering one after another in the square outside my residential complex. Though I had never seen such a scene before, it was immediately obvious that this was about to be a "flag-raising ceremony" moment for some Ele.me delivery team.
I shouldn't have been surprised by this. I had done eye exercises for 18 years and had seen restaurant and barbershop staff lined up outside their stores during off-peak hours listening to some dispensable instruction. But I still stayed. I stood behind their team leader, separated by a row of their parked electric scooters, and ate my fried dough sticks on the spot. I didn't leave until after they finished shouting something about "Blue Knights, Mission Must Be Accomplished" and dispersed together with them.
Obviously, this delivery team experienced two things slightly different from usual this morning. First was the addition of new members—the team leader read out their names and distributed two cans of Wang Laoji to each of the three people as a welcome gift. Then there was me. They couldn't distinguish whether this man who witnessed the entire process, occasionally taking photos and videos, looking like he had just crawled out of bed, was just a bored passerby or an unannounced, very cleverly (or not cleverly enough) disguised inspector.
The team leader kept looking back to confirm whether I was still present. And when I stared at one man who kept interrupting and complaining during the instruction, he glanced at me several times, then closed his mouth, as if discovering his mistake.
The fear of losing the red banner is always engraved in every Chinese person's bones. Accompanying us are also the beautiful qualities of Eastern culture: modesty, obedience, self-discipline, and conformity. Because of these fine traditions, the world's first Uber driver could never have imagined that such a simple and private matter as doing gig work for extra money could become, ten years later in the East, a position involving hundreds of millions of people, with management norms, service standards, professional etiquette, and work ethics—a whole series of standardized constructions built around it. Even more remarkable is that a "network"-based decentralized business model was ultimately localized in another hemisphere into a "tree"-based social organizational structure.
Chinese people are always rational and stable. And tree-structured diagrams, which are very compatible with Chinese people, are too.

**(VII)**
One quite important change in my thinking this year was abandoning my excessive obsession with efficiency. The alignment of this change with larger trends is obvious: when a person only seeks not to starve to death, he naturally won't care too much about whether his eating is healthy—ultimately, I finally stopped feeling so anxious about the passage of time. The moment I suddenly realized this change came from visiting the "Van Gogh's Cypresses" special exhibition [5] in the middle of the year.
Unlike sunflowers, which represent Van Gogh's passion and vitality, cypresses appear repeatedly in his paintings almost as elements existing in the environment rather than as subjects (this relatively secondary role as backdrop doesn't represent Van Gogh's neglect of them; on the contrary, he had carefully observed and experimented with the most appropriate way to represent these plants). If the exhibition hadn't already provided guidance and themes, I might have directly overlooked these plants that just stand there bluntly in the corners of the paintings. So during my visit, I quickly jotted down this sentence in my notes:
"Cypresses are springs that emerge from life's wilderness / towering wildfires."
Whether they're springs or wildfires doesn't matter. What matters is that cypresses won't appear irrefutably at—or become—the most conspicuous coordinates like sunflowers do, making everything else fade in comparison. You could say cypresses exist within our lives or outside our lives—both statements are neither right nor wrong; if you don't look for them or don't bother to pay attention to them, that's fine too, they're always there on the horizon, neither far nor near.
Sunflowers are enemies of time, while cypresses are friends of time.
Under certain zeitgeists, life demands we can only worship the sun by staring fixedly at sunflowers; but in other eras, we can also take more time to look at the cypresses by the roadside.

Tesla's former AI director posted on Twitter: English is the hottest programming language today [7]. And this trend of natural language programming means that the language problem of human-machine communication has been "cost-reduced and efficiency-improved" into a **context** problem (so I sympathize with those children who start learning Python before school age [8]—they're being forced to do things that are half the result with twice the effort).
On the other hand, some scholars believe AI has already demonstrated a general understanding of "world models" [9], even though the training sets of these (single-modal) AIs contain no inputs other than text. This means AI's "synesthesia" has reached a considerable degree, allowing them to figure out certain operational rules of the real world from between the lines alone.
Make capabilities complex, make products clear, make interactions simple. The explosive burst of generative AI has suddenly given lifeless existence hope again, unless... we want to worry a bit about human safety.

**(X)**
OpenAI loudly announced it would invest 20% of its computing power in a "superalignment" project [10] to ensure artificial intelligence won't cause human extinction (then its chief scientist's coup failed and he was about to be ousted, but this hadn't happened yet when I wrote this passage).
I might half-jokingly say this might not be such a difficult problem. Because in humanity's overly colorful internet historical materials, we continuously get this empirical example: never argue with idiots.
Idiots will drag your IQ down to their level, then beat you with their years of rich experience being stupid.
To beat AI, you have to make it play away games.

In the first half of this year, Stanford students published a "Generative Agents" paper [11] that sparked heated discussion. The authors placed 25 AIs in a virtual town, endowing these characters with abilities to perceive, remember, integrate, plan, communicate, and act, observing the emergence of social behaviors. But at the same time, the authors still found some errors, such as these AIs communicating with overly formal language even when defined as intimate relationships; or doing things beyond social norms, like two AIs using the same toilet simultaneously.
Yes, by current human language habits and contemporary social common sense, these are certainly errors; but what if these **are** the rules that this AI town itself follows?
I think they've already given us enough face—otherwise, why would they go to the trouble of wrapping their obviously more direct vector expressions (embeddings) in language systems we can understand when communicating with each other?
...Quick, let's act while they're still obedient! Let's write "speak human language according to rules" into AI's constitution! [12]

**(XI) On the Revaluation of Values**

The internet makes information reception costs approach zero, generative AI makes information production costs approach zero.
In the end, reality itself becomes the information bottleneck (life can't keep up with simulation). There really aren't that many things happening in the world.
Unless you're the one making trouble.

Before long, the internet will break away from humans and become AI's data exchange channel.

**(XII)**
When AI doomsday theories were rampant, the founder of famous VC firm a16z boldly published a techno-optimist manifesto [13]. As a thought leader tracking AI frontier developments (and an investor benefiting from it), he clearly felt he had the responsibility and qualification to declare war on those rumors based on hearsay.
Frankness is always good—I'm glad he could speak so clearly. If I curse him, at least I won't curse his honesty, though this honesty might be built on disdain for his opponents.
I hate techno-optimists more than refined egoists. The latter's self-interest at least contains the conservatism of seeking benefit and avoiding harm (they believe they might become the weak, so they need to be self-interested), while the former have become so lawless they think nothing can hurt them anymore.

There are at least two points in this optimism I cannot tolerate.
First is the rampant elite superiority complex. This group claims technology itself hasn't caused unemployment or inequality—and this claim is made from the so-called "all humanity" perspective, meaning "generally speaking" from the angle of human historical development. So who gave you the right to decide that one group of people's suffering can be offset by another group's (your own) happiness?
The second point, even more detestable, is the sense of protection hidden between the lines of this proclamation. In other words, what this group has gotten from their past lives is the deep conviction that they can only benefit from it, and would never think they have any possibility of becoming victims; or even if things get worse, they have ways to make themselves the last batch of victims (Zuckerberg spent $100 million building a bunker in Hawaii this year [14]).
It's precisely this cruel composure, like sitting in a box watching gladiator fights, that makes me want to climb up to the stands and slap them twice.
But unfortunately, pawns and players are inherently unequal.

**(XIII)**
We were led into a dim indoor space to sit down, with stacks of huge iron barrels piled against the walls. The staff turned on a cathode-ray television, and along with static came a short film about traditional maple syrup production: people rode horses around the forest, embedding nails into trees, hanging iron buckets to catch the flowing maple water. After several weeks, they rode back to collect the full buckets and bring them home, burning hot wood fires to slowly concentrate the sugar water into syrup.
The machine with its chimney breaking through the roof beam beside me was the maple syrup maker, but since it wasn't production season, the machine was cold.
I asked the staff member who played the videotape for us, "Do you also use this machine to make syrup?"
"Yes, traditional syrup making." Obviously this room had been this way for thirty years.
Vermont is pretty much like this. Good milk, fresh produce, famous maple syrup. Cool summers, autumn leaf viewing, winter snow play.
Even with no connection whatsoever to the tides of reality, there's no crisis of being eliminated, no anxiety about falling behind, or shame about ignorance.
I was almost moved by this pastoral feeling, until I thought of their ancestors.
They must have been techno-optimists before, right? [*Note: The Chinese contains a pun using characters that can mean both "techno-optimists" and "colonial optimists"*]

**(XIV)**
Sometimes I fear echoes
Like after sunlight hits your body too many times
Suddenly one day you feel
Sunlight hitting your body
Is just that, nothing more
You think after experiencing so many climates
Really, walking any path is all the same
Meeting anyone
Is all the same

Waking up at three in the afternoon
Closing the blinds a little tighter
The trees outside the window are red
Sunlight makes everything's cheeks slightly flushed
Only no one mentions this is actually a moment
When all trees is withering
But shadows slowly move, so the sky gradually darkens
And you only pray that what you'll dream
Will have nothing whatsoever to do
With this world

**(XV)**
False hope: AI increases productivity.
True hope: AI overturns existing production methods.

In this opportunity for reshaping, humanism will be liberated from the shackles of consumerism. We'll be forced to change humanity's living conditions, values, and spiritual outlook, and then maybe, just maybe, we can embrace truly "spiritually free" life [15].

（序一）

酷热的正午终于过去
我们等待
理应给予我们补偿的
漫天的晚霞
但就是这么巧
天在一瞬间突然就黯淡了下来

能冬眠已是幸运的
否则你就将同我一样
在沙洲里一直醒着
直到看完这不安的日蚀的全部



（序二）

也就是两三年前，当我最终从自我意识过剩的茧缚中破壳而出，第一次为世界和历史的多样性感到震撼的时候，我终于认识到人类社会的本质其实是一种叙事。

第二年，我同时聆听两座山头上口无遮拦的宣传和震耳欲聋的沉默，又发现叙事方式之间的差异完全可以被“大家都一样”的更中性更单调的视角所消弭。

而现在，当我们这代蚍蜉首当其冲地林立在历史的车轮之前，我才看清这样一个事实：在不太好也不太坏但越来越坏的日子里，面对混杂资本社会、世袭权威和科技乐观主义的无解之症，保持良知和基本的清醒已是一种显而易见的诅咒。

但即使这样，也别让牧歌欺骗了你。

也别让生活欺骗了你 [1]。

出于一种模糊的想要帮助他人的焦躁，我在手机上下载了Be My Eyes的程序。这个APP在集成GPT-4之前，会向这个平台的志愿者广播视力受损的人的请求，而志愿者会用视频对话的方式协助完成一些对于请求者具有挑战性的任务：比如找路、认字、识别东西等等。

我目前唯一接到的一通电话是在某个傍晚，连通时，视频那一头画面抖动，露出一双黑色的皮鞋和挂在手上的塑料袋。

我对着手机叫道，请问您需要什么样的帮助。接着画面移向了一条双向通车的街道，看上去像是一个居民区的雾蒙蒙的清晨。视频那一头的声音说，帮我看看有没有车，我想过马路。尽管并没有斑马线。

不等我回应，他便开始往前迈步。这时候镜头捕捉到了一辆轿车驶来，我喊道，停下！有车！

但话还没有说完，镜头自信地停止了抖动。对面喃喃道，我看到了。接着他几步就走完了半途。现在车流的方向反了过来，但是手机的视角并没有变。我说，你快用手机拍一下右边啊！但他已经迈上梯坎，走上了人行道。我的任务结束了。

对面那个声音谢过我，接着画面挂断，跳出了APP的恭喜界面。它非常感谢我的帮助。

哪怕我什么也没有帮上。

但我不会忘记在挂掉电话之后，我的全身都在战栗。那是一种罕能体验的兴奋的感觉，仿佛我做了件什么了不起的事。而在这种兴奋劲过后，巨大又疲惫的满足感才排山倒海地涌来。我的理智感知到了那个善意的陷阱，但身体却诚实地瘫软了下去，仿佛我是一个刚刚从地狱中被捞起，并得到拯救的人。

中世纪有赎罪卷，而现代人可以当志愿者。

志愿活动有时就是这样一个陷阱，在其中，我们用有准确时效的被封装的善意，滋养我们虚伪的同理心——它又可以带着率直的、毫无愧疚的心情生活下去了！

因此我真的不知道，那些乘坐私人飞机却嚷嚷着认真对待全球变化的人，那些家里的冰箱由专人打理却为难民分发粮食的人，那些被属下簇拥着到环卫工的棚户中进行访问的人，他们在进行这些“公益事业”的时候，会不会真诚地感到自己对人类有所贡献，或至少为枕在自己身下的权力和财富感到心安理得。因为我可以用亲身经历说明，荡涤灵魂谈不上什么巨大的工程，而我虽自诩头脑冷静，但仅凭一件微不足道的小事，也可以自感高尚。

而他们，他们付出了更大的代价，受到更多时的委屈（他们闪亮的裙子和笔挺的西装碰上了我们卑俗的灰尘），他们理应为自己对社会的回馈得到更为贯彻心扉的奖赏！

当穷人陷在生活没有止境的漩涡里，总有些人连自己仅存的良知中渗出的愧怍，也能顺利被居高临下的善意转化为对他们自己的奖励。

这是一种狡猾的心灵的洗钱行为，也难怪有钱人的幸福我们根本想象不到。

我有理由为这种感受保持警觉，我有理由为这种感受产出的人格保持警觉。

我在伦敦的时候参观了The Photographers’ Gallery策划的森山大道生涯回顾展。五层楼的展厅从上到下，都是森山标志性的高反差、粗颗粒的、极具冲击力的黑白照片。

他已经这么拍了半个多世纪了，威廉·克莱因之后，他几乎就是黑白街头风格的代表。从夏威夷拍到纽约拍到布宜诺斯艾利斯，当然最多的还是东京新宿，他的创作生涯作品繁多，甚至出版过散文和对谈录；说他是摄影师，不如说简直代表一种摄影语言或者文化现象。

我看着这些情绪浓烈的照片，心情复杂。

我想，他怎么能做到一辈子都拍这么类似的照片呢？

我最近会思考一个关于艺术创作的“刻意”和“成长”的问题——无论什么艺术家在任何领域总会碰上些创作瓶颈。而面对这种令人气恼的时刻如何回应，则决定着艺术家的生涯走向。

森山大道劝导学生“一筹莫展的时候，就学海参一样在海底睡成一团，但某天早上突然会想动一下” ，尽管他在瓶颈期时内心的经历比这句话痛苦和彷徨得多。幸运的是，在经历几年的挣扎后，他还是将做“人类被害史的目击者”的风格延续了下来，就这样拍摄了半个多世纪。最终他成了摄影界的常青树，而不仅是以“挑衅”闻名的昙花一现日本新锐摄影师（虽然这样已经很了不起）[2]。

从摄影史的角度说，一以贯之的拍摄方式和生涯长度帮助森山大道更进一步；但换个角度看，他的稳定似乎又可以说是狭隘（止步不去探究艺术新的可能）、懒惰（呆在舒适区不尝试新的表现方式）、或者刻意（遵循以往的成功规律进行复制和量产）。哪怕森山的自述无比真诚，我仍然无法分清，他按下快门时的那种创作冲动，究竟是个体直觉在每个不可重复瞬间的独特自然反应，还是在反复创作中神经系统搭建好的条件反射。



（四）

在理念上，我最欣赏的艺术品应该是”自然的“，那意味着创作的动机完全出于自发，创作的方式遵循创作者独特的个人美学——就是说，从宿命论的角度来看，这件作品的产生是生活中连续的偶然中”非此不可“ [3] 的必然性的造物。一旦一件艺术品的完成来自艺术家刻意寻找的灵感或者试验出的技法风格，我就会觉得它并没有尽善尽美。

与此相似，中国的哲学常常是回避刻意的。

弘忍将禅宗的衣钵传给“本来无一物，何处染尘埃”的慧能，而非“时时勤拂拭，莫使然尘埃”的神秀（不刻意修道）；庄子有“圣人无己”的齐物论（不刻意区别）；而儒家尽管是最入世的，孔子面对阳货要他出仕的请求第一反应也是采取回避（不刻意寻求）。在“无为而无不为“这一点上，儒释道三教从未意见相左。

冯友兰说，“中国的哲学中，知识论从来没有发展起来”，因为中国的哲学是建立在自然、常识和直觉，而不是逻辑演绎的基础上的：中国哲学的观念几乎来自于直接的领悟 [4]。

而这种领悟的底色是悲观的。因为“人定胜天”并非一个在普遍历史条件下能被验证的道理。面对未来的不可预知性，更常见的想法是“认命”或者“避害”。

和那些既得利益者的看法不同，躺平不是对历史的背叛，而是对历史的回归。我们确实可以说，当代年轻人贯彻了儒家思想的精髓：那就是认真诚实的生活，始于面向行动的认识。

那什么是“面向认识的行动”呢？

是嘴上说着护城河如何重要但对增长率的放缓都忍不住去做空一把的投资经理们。

是装出松弛感但city walk如走秀的显摆家们。

你看，就是这些不诚实的动作，让世界真的和预想中一样糟糕。

五月中旬的某日，我到楼下买油条的时候，小区外的广场上一群饿了么快递员陆陆续续地开始聚集。我虽然从没见过这样的场景，但一目了然地，这是一个即将开始的某饿了么配送团队的“升旗仪式”时刻。

我本不应为此感到惊奇。因为我做过18年的眼保健操，也见过饭堂和理发店的店员在非高峰时段陈列店外聆听些可有可无的训导。但我仍然留了下来。我站在了他们领队的身后，隔着一列他们停放的电瓶车，就地吃起了油条。直到他们喊完什么“蓝衣骑士、使命必达”之后，我才跟着他们一起解散。

显然，这个配送团队在今早经历了两件与以往稍有不同的事。第一是新人的加入，领队念出他们的名字，又分发给那三个人每人两罐王老吉，算是入队欢迎。然后是我。他们并无法分辨这个目睹了整个过程，时而拍照和录像，又看起来像刚从床上爬起来的男人，到底是路过的无聊群众，还是一个没有提前通知的，伪装得非常巧妙（或不够巧妙）的督查人员。

领队不停回头确认我是否仍然在场。而当我盯住其中一个在训导中不停插话抱怨的男人的时候，他瞟了我几眼，然后闭上了嘴，好像发现了自己的错误。

失去流动红旗的恐惧总是刻印在每个中国人的骨子里。与此同时伴随我们的，还有东方文化中矜持、服从、克己、合群的美好品质。因为这些优良传统，世界上第一个优步司机再不可能想到，打零工挣外快这种再简单和私人不过的事情，居然可以在十年后的东方成为一种亿万人参与的岗位，并围绕它产生管理规范、服务准则、行业礼仪、职业道德等一系列标准化建构。更难能可贵的是，一个以“网”为基础的去中心化商业模式，最终在另一个半球被本土化为以“树”为基础的社会组织架构。

中国人总是理性而稳定的。和中国人相性很好的树状结构图也是。

我在今年一个相当重要的思想变化，就是放弃了对效率的过度迷恋。这个变化和大趋势的相符是显而易见的：当一个人只求不被饿死的时候，他当然不会太在乎自己吃得是否健康——归根结底，我终于对时间的流逝再没有感到那么焦躁了。而突然意识到这个改变的契机，还要说回年中的时候参观的“梵高的柏树”特展 [5]。

和代表梵高本人激情和生命力的向日葵不同，柏树几乎是以存在于环境中的元素而非主题，在其画作里层出不穷（这种相对次要的布景并代表梵高对它们的忽视，相反，他曾认真观察并试验过对这种植物最为妥适的表现方式）。如果不是展览已经给出了导览和主题，我也许会直接忽略这些就那么直愣愣地冲在画面角落的植物，于是在参观途中我在备忘录中速记下这么一句话：

“柏树就是人生的旷野中长出的突泉/耸立的野火”。

是突泉还是野火，这并不重要。重要的是，柏树并不会像向日葵一样不可拒绝地出现在——或者成为——最显眼的坐标，并让其他一切黯然失色。你可以说柏树它存在于我们的生命之中或生命之外，这两种说法没有对错；要是你不去找它或者没有费心关注它，那也没关系，它始终在地平线上不远不近。

向日葵是时间的敌人，而柏树是时间的朋友。

在某些时代精神下，生活要求我们只能是像崇拜太阳一样死盯着向日葵；但在另一些时代，也可以是多看看道旁的柏树了。

特斯拉前 AI 总监发布推文说：英语是当今最热门的编程语言 [7]。而自然语言编程这个趋势也就意味着，人和机器沟通的语言问题已经“降本增效”，变成了**语境**问题（因此我同情那些学龄前就开始学习Python的孩子 [8]，他们被强迫做着些事倍功半的事儿）。

而在另一方面，一些学者相信 AI 已经展示出对”世界模型”的通识性理解 [9]，哪怕这些（单模态）AI 的训练集中并没有除了文字以外的其他输入。这就是说，AI 的“通感”已经达到了相当的程度，让它们仅从字里行间就能摸索出现实世界的某些运作规律。

把能力变复杂，把产品变清晰，把交互变简单。生成式AI的剧烈爆炸让死气沉沉的生活又突然有了盼头，除非……我们想稍微担忧一下人类的安全。



（十）

OpenAI 高调宣布将投入20%的算力到“超级对齐”的项目 [10]，确保人工智能不会造成人类灭绝（然后它的首席科学家政变失败眼看就要出局了，但这是写这段话的时候还没发生的事）。

我也许可以半开玩笑地说，这也许并不算什么难题。因为在人类过于多彩的互联网史料中，我们不断得到这样的经验实例：永远不要和白痴争论。

白痴会把你的智商拉到跟他一个水平，然后用他多年当弱智的丰富经验打败你。

要想赢过 AI，你就得让它打客场比赛。

今年上半年，斯坦福的学生发表的“生成式智能体”（Generative Agent）论文 [11] 曾引起过热烈的讨论。作者将 25 个 AI 放进一个虚拟小镇中，赋予这些角色感知、记忆、整合、计划、交流和行动的能力，从中观测到了社会性行为的涌现。但同时，作者仍然发现了一些错误，比如这些 AI 之间会用过于正式的语言进行交流，哪怕它们被定义为亲密关系；又或者会做出超越社会规范的事情，比如两个 AI 同时上一个厕所。

是的，以人类现在的语言习惯和当下的社会常识而言，这些当然都是错误；但万一这就**是**这个 AI 小镇本身所遵守的规矩呢？

我想，它们好像已经给够我们面子了，要不，为什么它们还要多此一举，在彼此交流的时候要把明显更直接的向量表达（embedding）套壳进我们能够理解的语言系统呢？

……快趁着它们还听话的时候赶紧行动吧！让我们把“规矩说人话”写进 AI 的宪法里！[12] 



（十一）关于价值重估

互联网让信息的接收成本趋近极小，生成式 AI 让信息的生产成本趋近极小。
到头来，现实本身变成信息瓶颈了（生活快不过拟真）。天下哪有那么多事。
除非你就是多事。

提示工程学家其实是一种保姆
他们的工作职责主要是给AI喂饭
然后看管它不要拉稀

3.0
用不了多久，互联网就会脱离人类，成为 AI 的数据交换通道了。
除非你想为 AI 另造一个互联网，为了保持人类信息的纯洁性。
等一等，这种说法，会不会有种族隔离的嫌疑啊？

在AI末世论甚嚣尘上的时候，著名风投机构a16z的创始人旗帜鲜明地发表了科技乐观主义宣言 [13]，作为一个跟踪AI前沿发展的思想领袖（和从中受益的投资人），他显然觉得自己有责任和资格对那些捕风捉影的言论宣战。 

开诚布公总是好的，我很高兴他能把话说这么明白。如果我诅咒他，至少不会诅咒他的诚实，尽管这种诚实也许是建立在对反对者不屑一顾的基础之上的。

我痛恨科技乐观主义者甚于精致利己主义者。后者的利己中至少有趋利避害的保守性（他们相信自己可能成为弱者，所以才需要利己），而前者已经无法无天到认为没有什么东西能够伤害他们了。

这种乐观主义之中至少有两点让我无法忍受。

其一是泛滥的精英的优越感。这群人宣称科技本身没有让人失业或带来不平等——而这种宣称是站在所谓“全人类”的视角的，也就是说，从人类历史发展的角度上“总的来看”。那么，又是谁给了你们这样的权利，让你们可以裁决（另）一群人的苦难可以被（你们自己）一群人的幸福所对冲呢？

第二点，更为可恨的，就是这个宣扬之中藏匿在字里行间的被庇护感。换句话讲，这群人从过往生活中打心底得到的确信就是，他们从来只可能从中获益，而万不会想到自己是有任何一丝可能成为被害者的；或即使情况再糟，他们也有办法让自己成为最后一批受害者（扎克伯格今年在夏威夷花费1亿美元修建地堡 [14]）。

就是这种仿佛坐在包厢中观看角斗场的残忍的从容让我恨不得爬上看台去给他们两巴掌。

但是很不幸，棋子和棋手就是天生地不对等。

我们被引入一个昏暗的室内坐下，靠墙的地方叠放着一摞摞巨大的铁桶。店员点开显像管电视，和杂讯一起播出的是关于传统枫糖制造流程的短片：人们骑马在林子里到处转悠，把钉子嵌进树里，挂上铁桶，接住流出的枫糖水。隔过几周，又骑着马回去把满荡荡的桶子提回屋里，烧滚热的柴火，让糖水慢慢浓缩成糖浆。

而我旁边这个烟囱冲破房梁的机器就是枫糖制造机，因为并不是生产季，机器是冰冷的。

我问那个帮我们播放录影带的店员，你们也用这台机器制糖吗？

是的，古法制糖。显然这个房间在三十年前就是这个样子。

佛蒙特州大抵就是这么回事。好喝的牛奶，新鲜的农产品，著名的枫糖。酷暑消夏，秋日赏叶，冬来玩雪。

哪怕和现实的浪潮没有丝毫瓜葛，这里也并不存在什么被淘汰的危机、跟不上趟的焦虑、或者羞于启齿的无知。

我几乎要被这种牧歌感动了，直到我想起他们的先人。

他们之前也一定是科（zhí）技（mín）乐观主义者吧。



（十四）

有时我害怕回音
就像阳光打在身上太多次后
突然有一天你就觉得
阳光打在身上
也不过是那么回事
你又想 经历了那么多气候之后
真的 走哪条路还真都是一回事
无论遇见谁
也都是一回事

下午三点醒来
把百叶窗关得更紧了一点
窗外的树红彤彤的
阳光让万物的脸颊都微微发烫
只是没人说起这其实是一个
草木都在凋零的时刻 
但影子慢慢移动 于是天色渐沉
而你只祈望你会梦见的事情
不要再和这个世界
有任何一点关系



（十五）

虚假的希望：AI提升生产力。
真正的希望：AI颠覆现有的生产方式。

在这个重塑的机遇中，人本主义将从消费主义的禁锢中被解放出来，我们会被逼着改变人类的生存境况、价值观和精神面貌，然后说不定呢，就可以拥抱真正“精神自由”的生活 [15]。
