#### [Rome · Vatican]
There were once people who spent their entire lives merely copying the countenance of Jesus. Looking at those statues constantly battered by camera flashes, I thought that perhaps only they deserved to be called true men of ambition.
The entire church is one grand altar, its elaborate decorations crystallizing the wealth of an entire generation—and perhaps from beginning to end, it was all merely to satisfy certain people's desires. Yet its value cannot be denied, if only for the sake of those who come to worship, its value cannot be negated. As someone who seeks more than purely religious fulfillment, what I see within is the brilliant radiance of the human spirit, in the aesthetic sense, in the architectural sense. I imagine that every craftsman working on the scaffolding, when they bent down from the dome to gaze upon the towns spread below, must have had a moment of trance-like belief that they were building the Tower of Babel. This is a great endeavor, from ancient times to the present.

#### [Florence]
As I wandered through the Uffizi Gallery, I saw many Jesuses and many Marys. The Jesuses and Marys possessed faces of every kind—this was self-evident—because judging from the artists' respective eras, works from the Middle Ages to the early Renaissance were mostly religious in theme. But I wondered: since each painter held different archetypal images of Jesus and Mary in their hearts, could it be that they themselves were not individuals, but rather collections? Yes, in this torrent of history, all who lead by example, bearing humanity's destiny forward, could be crowned with the title of Jesus; all who are chaste and noble are also part of the composition of the Holy Mother. The definitions of Jesus and the Holy Mother are gradually enriching, and thus they are able to manifest different faces. They represent humanity's pursuits, expectations, and desires.
Climbing the curved, narrow, and dim passageways of the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, I felt in a trance as if I were traveling upstream through the church's esophagus. The silhouettes ahead of me swayed crookedly, so much so that at times I mistook them for the ghostly shadows left by tourists who had climbed to the top before. But how could it not be so? This great cathedral swallows and disgorges thousands of tourists daily—who could possibly be truly remembered by this thing that has stood for hundreds of years? Standing on the observation deck of the dome, I gazed down imperiously at Florence's red and white residences nestled between hills and white clouds. I imagined that this behemoth, from the day its construction was completed, had strangely begun a new life of its own accord, no longer belonging to humanity, but becoming a solid fortress reaching toward the sky like a medium's banner. In its temporal scale, the bustling tourists and residents of this city over the centuries constitute nothing more than something like flowing water—if we were to overlay all the eras. This flowing water constantly evaporates under the sun, from those channels separated by red and white houses; and viewed from the distant mountains, these residences too are nothing more than the massive root system that the church has extended in all directions for its growth!

What remains is solely the church; truly alive is only the church.
Humanity! How pale and powerless you appear when facing this creation of your own! But perhaps it is precisely because of this that we find it necessary to create the church.

Let us continue the metaphor of flowing water. When our physical shells also break free from the shackles of self-consciousness, we can likewise see that the images of our entire lives are nothing more than the flowing water that rushes through this shell. Yes, as Mr. Haruki Murakami said, "I am merely a conduit for this person that is me."

#### [Cinque Terre]
Still on time's leeward slope
Like a general galloping his horse through ranks of crops
Reining in to survey all around, asking the plants
Has everyone grown well today?

The village grows from the mountaintop
Then slides along the ridge toward the plain
Those waters that drip and pierce along the mountain streams—
Thus the city is nurtured into being

#### [Train Reverie]
Mr. Haruki Murakami's creative process essentially tells us this fact about exploring life: we pursue hope and meaning, yet often escape into the ethereal; then we affirm the value of our own struggle and endurance, affirming our recognition that we must bear something because we have fallen into this world; finally we begin to believe in the power of love, becoming warriors of love, embarking on a path entirely governed by causation and circumstance. Those who truly embark on this path probably understand that love is the core of the human spirit. Carrying this conviction, they wait in happiness, or grow in happiness. Yes, the world turns because of love.

#### 【罗马·梵蒂冈】

从前有些人，光是为了临摹耶稣的容貌就花上了一辈子。我看着那些被闪光灯不停拍打的雕像，心想也许只有他们，才配被称为真正的野心家。

整个教堂就是一个大祭坛，那些繁复的装饰凝结了一整个世代的财富——而也许从头至尾只是为了满足某些人的欲望。可是它的价值无法被否定，即使只是为了那些朝拜的人它的价值也不能被否定。作为一个不单纯满足宗教的人，我从中看到的是人类精神熠熠的闪光，从美学的意义上，从建筑学的意义上。我想每一个在梯架上工作的工匠，当他们在穹顶俯身看向铺在地上的市镇的时候，他们总有一个瞬间恍惚相信自己正在修建巴别塔。这是一项伟大的事业，从古至今都是。


#### 【佛罗伦萨】

当我漫游在乌菲兹美术馆里的时候，我看到了许多的耶稣和许多的玛丽。耶稣和玛丽们拥有各式的面孔——这是显而易见的事——因为从画家的从属的时代来说，从中世纪到文艺复兴早期的作品大多是宗教题材。可是我就想，既然每个画家心中都拥有不同理型的耶稣和玛利亚的形象，有没有可能他们本身就不是一个个体，而是一个集合呢？是的，在这条历史的洪流中，所有以身作则，背负人类命运前进的人都可以被冠以耶稣的称号；所有贞洁而高尚的人也都是圣母的组成部分。耶稣和圣母的定义是逐渐在丰富的，而因此他们才得以显现不同的面孔。他们代表了人类的追求、期待和愿望。

攀爬百花圣母大教堂的弯曲、促狭而昏暗的甬道，我恍惚觉得自己是在教堂的食道里逆流而上。我前面的人影歪歪斜斜地摇曳着，以至于有些时刻我竟把它们当做以前登顶的游客留下的鬼影。其实又何尝不是呢？这个大教堂每天吞吐上千的游客，谁又有可能真正被这个矗立了几百年的东西记住呢？我站在穹顶的观景台上，睥睨翡冷翠夹在丘陵和白云之间红红白白的住宅。我想象着，这个庞然大物，自修建竣工之日起，就奇怪地自顾自地开始了新的生命，不再属于人类，而成为了类似灵媒的招展地伸向天空的坚固堡垒。在它的时间刻度里，这个城市几百年来熙熙攘攘的游客和居民不过构成了一种水流般的东西——如果我们将所有的时代重叠起来的话。这些流水在太阳底下不断蒸发着，从那些被红红白白的房子隔开的沟洫里；而从远处的山峦眺望过来，这些住宅也不过是教堂为了生长而延展四方的庞大根系！

剩下来的唯独教堂，真正活着的只有教堂。

人类！你们在面对这个自身创造之物时显得多么苍白无力！可是也许正是因为这样，我们才有必要把教堂创造出来吧。

让我们继续水流的隐喻。当我们的躯壳也脱离了自身意识的枷锁，我们同样可以看见自己一生的影像不过是这副躯壳中冲刷而过的水流。是的，正如村上春树先生所说，“我不过是我这个人的一条通道”。


#### 【五渔村】

静止在时光的背风坡
像将军策马在行列的庄稼中奔驰
立马而四顾 向植物问道
今天的大家 都有好好地生长吗？

村庄从山顶长起
然后沿着山脊滑向平原
那些沿着山涧滴穿的流水
城市就这样被喂养起来


#### 【火车狂想】

村上春树先生的创作过程，无非告诉我们这样一个探寻人生的事实：我们追寻希望和意义，却往往遁于缥缈；而后我们肯定自身奋斗和忍耐的价值，肯定自身因堕入人世而必须背负什么的认识；最后我们开始相信爱的力量，化身爱的战士，踏上一条全然被因缘所左右的道路。真正踏上这条道路的人大概知晓了爱才是人类精神的内核。他们怀着这种确信，幸福中等待，或者、在幸福中生长。是的，世界因爱而转动。
