The moment I stepped out of the cabin, the humid heat that struck my face awakened my memories of the tropics like a thunderclap: even though we had barely entered early summer, the Pearl River Delta was anything but gentle.
As part of a travel plan that hadn't been thoroughly thought through, we would spend the next four days hastily passing through three cities with populations exceeding ten million: Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Dongguan. Traveling in temperatures over thirty degrees Celsius might have been far from ideal; yet it was precisely in this relentless journey that the astonishing differences in modernity between these three cities—each no more than two hours' drive from the others—came crashing into view at eighty kilometers per hour, shattering any idealized notion of uniformity.
Diversity is inevitable and fascinating in any era, even when the entire Pearl River Delta belongs to the vanguard of reform and opening-up, even when all of us on this vast land have pledged to follow the twenty-four-character core socialist values.

### Guangzhou's Inertia
Looking out from the overpass toward the headquarters of Guangdong Radio and Television, the low-saturation golden lettering and magenta exterior decorations on the building's facade, so full of period character, had been bleached by this steamer-like weather. The sign for the New Yue Xin Hotel standing in front of it bore a name whose 40% repetitive emphasis was in complete contradiction to reality.
Looking back, the Tianxiu Building stood tall and proud at the other end of Xiaobei Road. On the southeast corner of this building's ground floor was a narrow entrance to the B2 Trading Center, where a man sat cross-legged on a plastic stool, having kicked off his flip-flops. On the surface, he appeared to be running at least three businesses—enormous canvas bags and counterfeit YSL handbags hung above his head; his counter bore the words "Currency Exchange" in English and Arabic; and below these words were printed images of eight different SIM cards.
Yet his glass counter contained only a roll of tape, a motorcycle helmet, tissues, a lunch box, and toothpicks. This perhaps revealed his fourth business: living. (As the man, so the building—truly "Tianxiu" [Heaven's Beauty].)
Crossing the overpass, the alleys of Baohan Straight Street bustled with activity. The Libya Road Trading Company sold North African colorful robes, women in headscarves sat on the back seats of electric scooters selecting naan bread from street vendors, electronic music with distinct beats emanated from halal restaurants, Black men spoke loudly on phones in fruit shops, and middle school students walked home from school, all looking down at their phones. A random glance down a small path branching off from the main street revealed places where sunlight barely penetrated, yet more electrical wires, hanging laundry, and bright red signs flourished: rental information, adult products, welfare lottery.
Guangzhou emphasizes "diversity and tolerance, harmony above all"—this was both the life philosophy of these diverse characters and the safety notice painted on walls by the Dengfeng Street Office.
Since the opening of the five treaty ports, Guangzhou's internationalization has been unquestionable. But this internationalization wasn't foreign mansions built from nothing; rather, it was the qilou (arcade buildings) that grew from this ancient Lingnan soil, blending Chinese and Western elements—Guangzhou's internationalization was also localization.
For an ancient city that hadn't undergone a complete restart, the impact of modernity didn't appear as wildfire consuming everything on virgin land, but rather like continued sedimentation on an already heavy riverbed. Guangzhou thus displayed a certain inertia: it wouldn't be reshaped overnight, but was infiltrated drop by drop wherever traditional ways loosened their grip.
Banlangen herbal tea wouldn't disappear, but could be bottled in plastic for convenience; the BabiBoy and NewBaiLun shops on Shangxiajiu wouldn't disappear, but they also accepted WeChat and Alipay payments...
Should Guangzhou have faster change? In other words, is Guangzhou burdened by its history? If we measure only by modernity, we seem to see only how this pioneer zone of reform and opening-up has been mercilessly gnawed by time: faded buildings, narrow streets, chaotic urban villages...
But could this messiness also be the source of this city's composure?
When taking a car in Guangzhou, navigation systems countless times announce "After making a U-turn, please turn right," even when the driver hasn't taken a wrong route—this is the inevitable compromise this busy city must make in traffic planning. Not perfect, but a kind of solution.
And there's another, much larger kind of U-turn (the U-turn called "macroeconomic regulation"!). Such U-turns are sometimes unsolvable, and we see not just a few households or factories, but perhaps an entire city completely losing its vitality for survival—Guangzhou, historically speaking, indeed doesn't have such worries—perhaps precisely because of its chaos, it has gained a complex identity that's hard to define.
Guangzhou can hardly improve overnight, but therefore cannot quickly deteriorate either.
Guangzhou provides China's younger cities with such a sample: how to grow thorny, how to age gracefully.

### Shenzhen's Fractals
Most of Shekou has completely become a pleasant residential area.
High-rise apartments and shopping centers stand everywhere, with even taller, newer, more magnificent buildings constantly rising from the ground. The China Merchants Museum is nestled in rare woodlands in this area. Apart from the inscription "Time is money, efficiency is life" written on the decorative wall facing traffic at its northwest corner, you can hardly glimpse from this artistically appealing building the fierce, enterprising, and pioneering spirit that the first experimental zone for opening-up after the founding of New China should have embodied.
Yet on the other side of Nanshan, Shenzhen Port—the third busiest in China and fourth globally—works day and night. That's a completely different Shenzhen.
As a special economic zone built from scratch, Shenzhen had no burdens from the beginning. It only needed to do one thing well: become the frontier of China's reform and opening-up. All these years, Shenzhen has done very well. It hasn't wasted its locational advantages, it hasn't missed any major transformation opportunities, and it is China's most influential special economic zone.
Shenzhen possesses almost everything other cities envy, so the answer Shenzhen provides is also idealized.
Leaving Shekou, heading north on Shahe West Road then eastward, Binhai Avenue becomes Binhe Avenue after crossing the Beijing-Hong Kong-Macao Expressway. We drove from Nanshan District to Futian, Shenzhen's central urban area (continuing forward would take us to Luohu, the earliest developed district in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone). To our right throughout the journey was the silent surface of Shenzhen Bay and Hong Kong in the distance; to our left, the urban pattern of "residential-leisure-commercial zones" played on repeat. They appeared so orderly and consistent that without relying on certain landmark buildings, I would have difficulty distinguishing between these mutually separated yet functionally similar areas.
I've seen this same kind of urban settlement in Tokyo, composed of "multiple centers" (though Shenzhen is far simpler than Tokyo)—yes, you cannot call Shenzhen a single city. It doesn't have the growth trajectory of my hometown, growing in rings like tree rings, nor does it have Paris's radial neural tentacles connecting all of France. Shenzhen's different urban blocks are like motifs varied by some composer in a musical work—they are mutually separated, constantly repeated, establishing the fundamental tone of the entire piece.
And Shenzhen's fundamental tone is functionality.
Each building has its function; each municipal facility has its function; each person has their function. Once these things are modularized, we can assemble Shenzhen block by block like in "Minecraft."
"Commercial-leisure-residential"—this should be the smallest unit that social living needs can be simplified to, and this is also the future-oriented reality constructed by Shenzhen's "fractals": Shenzhen is a city, but also a cluster of urban tribes; Shenzhen's districts resemble each other, as if they could be transplanted at any time and adapt to any direction in this city.
Shenzhen is replicable, but the Shenzhen Special Zone is so ideal, so unique, that it fundamentally cannot be replicated.

### Dongguan's Blank Space
On the eve of May 20th, the Global Trade Center in Dongguan's central CBD lit up the entire building, with neon tubes scrolling this blessing:
Warm Congratulations on World Metrology Day. —Dongguan Market Supervision Administration
Other buildings standing sparsely in this central square area hadn't yet caught up with the trending topic. Against striking red or blue backgrounds, they displayed phone numbers: For advertising space rental, please call.
Friday, the eve of May 20th—Dongguan remained calm as still water.
The next day, we visited Keyuan Garden. Standing on the third-floor pavilion looking south, the Venus Royal Hotel dominated the south bank of the canal (royal treatment for just over 200 yuan); looking east, two buildings with distinctly Soviet Futurist style faced each other across the distance: the Red Brick Building wore a "丰" [abundance] character-shaped hat, while the Dongguan Overseas Chinese Hotel was crowned with two satellite receivers opening toward the sky.
They stand there in the early 2020s as if frozen in some giant amber. Certain areas of Dongguan are like Pompeii that wasn't covered by volcanic ash—we watch them motionless on the surface, having stopped growing.
That's just how Dongguan is. It has the most dazzling all-glass central business district, and also landmarks that seem wildly imaginative, as if built when China had just begun its modernization process in the last century. But between these two extremes, Dongguan's history seems to have a hole.
On Bada Road, just a five-minute drive from the city center, hardware and electrical wholesale businesses line both sides: gears, screws, valves, cables... Apart from Huali Market serving as a gathering place, these shops are spread across the ground floors of buildings on both sides of this street, seeping into various branching alleys. These storefronts form the background of Dongguan as a manufacturing powerhouse, but they also make this city of over ten million people remarkably similar to a Chinese county town in many details.
Even worse than that.
Dongguan spiritually lacks the marketplace atmosphere common even in small county towns. Dongguan seems completely stripped of life-oriented attributes. If Shenzhen's functionality still accommodates and forms a "futuristic" lifestyle for a city, Dongguan's functionality is far more pure: it's almost merely a machine designed to operate.
Dongguan is incomplete. Dongguan's advertising spaces wait to be filled, just as Dongguan waits for real life to arrive.

仅在踏出舱门的一瞬间，扑面而来的潮热就惊雷般震醒了我关于热带的记忆：尽管刚迈入初夏，珠三角也并不温柔。

作为一个并未深思熟虑的旅行计划，我们将在接下来的四天时间里匆匆略过三座常住人口超过千万的城市：广州，深圳，东莞。在三十多度的暑气中辗转，这样的旅途也许差强人意；但正是在这不停歇的游历中，这三座相互车程不超过两小时的城市间令人惊异的现代性之差，才得以以时速八十公里的冲击，把那种理想化的同一性建构撞得粉碎。

无论在什么时代，多样性都是必然且迷人的，哪怕整个珠三角都隶属改革开放的先行地，哪怕这片广袤土地上所有的我们都已誓言遵循二十四字的核心价值观。



**广州惯性**

从天桥眺望广东广播电视台总部，那楼面上充满年代感的低饱和度的金色字体和洋红的外墙装饰已被这蒸笼般的天气熏得褪色。它的更前面立着的新粤新酒店的招牌，这个店名中重复强调的40%的成分正和现实情况完全相反。

往后看去，天秀大厦在小北路的另一头昂然挺立。这座大厦一楼的东南角有一个B2商贸城的窄窄的入口，那里一个男人脱掉拖鞋盘脚坐在塑料凳上：表面看去，他至少经营着三样业务——他的头顶挂着巨大的帆布袋子和仿冒的YSL提包；他的柜台上用英文和阿拉伯文写着“货币兑换”；而这些文字下面打印着八种SIM卡的图像。

但他身前的玻璃柜台里却只放着一卷胶带、一顶摩托车头盔、纸巾、饭盒和牙签。这也许说明了他的第四种业务：生活。（人如此楼，果真天秀）

跨过天桥，宝汉直街的巷道里热闹非凡。利比路商行贩卖着北非鲜艳的褂子，戴头巾的女人坐在电瓶车后座上挑选着占道经营的馕饼，清真食堂中传出节拍分明的电子音乐，黑人在水果店里大声打电话，中学生放学回家，他们走路也全都低头看着手机。随机瞥往一个从主街分叉的小径，几乎不透进阳光的地方正生长着更多的电线、晾晒衣服和响亮的红色招牌：租房信息、情趣用品、福利彩票。

广州讲究“多元包容，以和为贵”：这既是这些形形色色的人物的处世信条，也是登峰街道办事处涂在墙上的安全须知。

自五口通商开始，广州的国际化就已无可置疑。但这种国际化并不是凭空造起的洋房，而是从这片悠悠历史的岭南土壤中生长出的中西结合的骑楼——广州的国际化也是本土化的。

对于一个没有历经重启的古老城市，现代性的冲击并不以莽原上的野火般燃尽一切的方式出现，却仿佛是在本就厚重的河床上继续堆积泥沙，广州由此显现出某种惯性：它不会被一夜之间重塑，只是在每一个传统方式松动的地方点点滴滴地被渗入。

癍痧凉茶不会消失，但可以选择灌装在塑料瓶中方便携带；上下九的BabiBoy和NewBaiLun不会消失，但它们也接受微信和支付宝的汇款……

广州是否应该拥有更快速的改变？换句话说，广州是否被其历史所拖累？如果仅仅以现代性来衡量，我们似乎只能看到这片改革开放先行区被时光无情啃噬的一面：褪色的楼宇，狭窄的街道，混乱的城中村……

但这种芜杂是否也同时是这座城市从容的源头？

在广州乘车，导航中无数次传出”调头后请右转“的提示，哪怕司机并未走错道路——这是这个繁忙的城市在交通规划上必然做出的妥协。不够完美，但算一种解决方式。

而还有一种更为巨大的调头（名为“宏观调控“的调头！）。那样的调头有时是无解的，我们看到不仅是几户人家，几个工厂，而也许是一整个城市全然丧失掉自己的生存热情——广州从历史上看，确实没有这样的忧虞——也许正是因为它的混乱，给了它难以界定的复合身份。

广州很难转眼变得更好，但也因此无法很快变坏。

广州为中国更为年轻的城市们提供了这样一个样本，即如何生长得棘手，如何让自己从容地老去。



**深圳分形**

蛇口的大部分地方完全成为了惬意的生活区。

这里林立各式高层公寓和购物中心，还不断有更高更新更雄伟的建筑拔地而起。招商局历史博物馆掩映在这片区域罕见的林地中，除去其西北角正对车流的装饰墙上题写的“时间就是金钱，效率就是生命”，你再难从这座充满艺术气息外观的建筑中窥见这新中国成立后对外开放的第一个试验区所本该喷薄的勇猛、进取和草莽的精神。

而就在南山的另一面，中国第三、全球第四繁忙的深圳港正夜以继日地工作，那又是一个完全不同的深圳。

作为从零开始的经济特区，深圳从一开始就没有任何负担，它只需做好一件事，成为中国的改革开放的前沿。这么些年，深圳一直做得很好。它没有浪费自己的区位优势，它没有错过任何重大的转型机会，它是中国影响力最大的经济特区。

深圳几乎拥有其他城市羡慕的一切，因此深圳给出的答案也是理想化的。

离开蛇口，从沙河西路北上然后一路东行，滨海大道在穿过京港澳高速后变成滨河大道，我们从南山区行车抵达深圳的中心城区福田 （若继续向前便可以进入罗湖，深圳经济特区中最早开发的城区）。车子的右舷始终是深圳湾沉默的海面和更远处的香港，左舷则反复播放着“居民-休闲-商业区”的城市业态。它们在观感上是如此井井有条而具有一致性，如果不是依赖某些具有地标特色的建筑，我将很难分辨出这些相互间隔而功能相似的区域。

我在东京见过这种同样的，以“复数式的中心”构成的城市聚落（尽管深圳远比东京简洁）——是的，你无法把深圳称作一个城市——它不似我的故乡般有着年轮一样一圈圈长大的发展轨迹，也不似巴黎般有着放射状的连结整个法兰西的神经触须。深圳不同的城市区块就仿佛是某个作曲家在作品中变奏的动机，它们被相互区隔，不断反复，奠定着整部作品的基调。

而深圳的基调就是功能性。

每栋建筑有每栋建筑的功能；每个市政设施有每个市政设施的功能；每个人有每个人的功能。一旦这些东西被模块化，我们就可以如“我的世界”一般把深圳一个街区一个街区地组装起来。

“商业-休闲-居住”，这应该就是社会生活需求所能精简到的最小单位，而这也是深圳的”分形“所建构出的充满现实意义的未来感：深圳是城市，也是一簇城市的部落；深圳的街区彼此相似，仿佛随时可以被移植，并适应这个城市的任何方位。

深圳是可复制的，但深圳特区是这么理想这么独特，这又使得它从根本上不可能被复制。



**东莞留白**

5月20日前夜，东莞市中央CBD的环球经贸中心把整个大楼点亮，那些霓虹灯管上滚动出这样的祝福：

热烈庆祝世界计量日。——东莞市市场监管局

这片中心广场区域其他稀稀落落地耸立着的其他大厦则还没有跟上热点，它们用或红或蓝的显眼背景留下一串手机号：广告位招商请致电。

星期五，5月20日前夜，东莞波澜不兴。

第二日，我们游览可园。站在三层阁楼向南眺望，维纳斯皇家酒店雄踞于运河南岸（仅需两百出头的皇家礼遇）；往东看，两幢颇具苏联未来主义风格的建筑遥相对望：红砖楼大厦戴着一个“丰”字型的帽子，东莞华侨大酒店则头顶两个向天空展开的卫星信号接收器。

它们这样屹立在21世纪20年代的年头里，就像是被某种巨大的琥珀凝固住了。东莞的某些地区就像是没有被火山灰覆盖的庞贝，我们眼睁睁地看着它们在地表静止着，停止生长。

东莞就是这样。它有着最为闪亮的全玻璃大楼的中央商业区，也有仿佛是上世纪中国刚刚开始现代化进程时所修建的最为天马行空的地标。但在这两者中间，东莞的历史好像存在一个窟窿。

在距离市中心仅五分钟车程的八达路上，两侧林林总总地排布五金和机电的批发生意：齿轮、螺丝、阀门、线缆……除去一个作为聚集地的华利市场，这些商店就平铺在这条街两侧楼房的底层，并渗进各个分叉的巷道中。这些铺面构成了东莞作为制造业重镇的底色，但它们也同时使这个人口超过千万的城市在很多细节上无比近似一座中国的县城。

甚至不如。

东莞在精神上缺失着哪怕在小县城里也常见的市井的气息，东莞像是完全被剥离了生活化的属性。如果说深圳的功能性还兼顾和形成着一座城市的“未来感”的生活方式，东莞的功能性则远为纯粹：它几乎仅就是一台用来运行的机器。

东莞并不完整。东莞的广告展位等待被填满，正如东莞等待真正的生活降临。
