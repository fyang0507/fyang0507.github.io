### (I) Culebra and Vieques
Vehicles plow back and forth repeatedly along the narrow coastline. Oncoming traffic is not infrequent, yet the road maintains a width that falls just short of being a proper two-lane highway—much like the occasional torrential sunlight pouring through the slowly shifting gaps in the clouds, bringing persistent minor discomfort and intermittent intense torment.
A clearly well-worn passenger van bounces us toward our lodging. The air conditioning runs at full blast but shows little strength in performance, resembling an energetic but utterly tactless salesperson. The driver charged only the transport fee yet voluntarily assumed the role of guide, so I came to know that along the way we passed what were perhaps sites of commemorative significance: the island's only Catholic church, only municipal government building, only steel-structured bridge... The vehicle occasionally slowed to avoid the idle yellow dogs, cats, roosters, or wild horses in the middle of the road.
Viewed through the glass, one could certainly call it a streamlined and pleasant village, even prosperous—quite a number of sailboats and yachts were moored or floating in the shimmering inner bay.
But only through movement that constantly changed our perspective did unsettling signals arrive intermittently. Such as abandoned cars in the roadside weeds, crooked and indecipherable advertising signs, uninhabited detached buildings with broken windows, and a shuttered commercial street utterly inappropriate for a popular vacation destination—especially on Thanksgiving.
Under the blazing sun, in heat that melted everything, all things remained silent, save for the vines that emanated an almost visible vapor of growth. They crawled on the ground, clustered by the sea, hung suspended from branches—they lived with an evolutionary stance perfectly adapted to the climate, covering mountains and fields. They could devour anything, just as plague could infect everything.
At dusk, the sun sank with fatalistic surrender. The thick clouds disappeared like gradually opening curtains, and that sphere completely exposed above the sea level suddenly mustered its strength again, leaving the entire firmament with a glorious sigh that lingered long. But ultimately, blue was victorious. Blue is stubborn—even at noon when it was penetrated and burned, approaching transparency... Finally, Orion's belt lit up.
As night fell, the streetlights along the coastal road emitted an ominous red glow (yes, pure red light). This was a node suitable for dark things to prowl and emerge (what lurked behind those crumbling, pallid walls?), and only with the absolute mechanical nature of a jeep's steel frame could one resist the erosion that the entire night would inevitably bring. Curled up in this shelter while driving along the road, thankfully there were sparse taverns emanating the cold, unwarming light of incandescent bulbs. You know that artificial noise can flow from within such light, so you call this temporary peace of mind "home."
You see, this small town is essentially dead, or at least seriously ill.

### (II) Bioluminescent Beach
The transparent-bottomed kayak gradually ignites fine points of light following the water's flow, as if in the vast darkness, a persistent arrow was creating fire through friction.
Further from shore, the entire body of water becomes a magical catalyst. Stirring the sea surface, the ripples are instantaneously materialized, like a visible echo of music.
The paddle moves rhythmically, light flickers and appears intermittently because of it. I try my best to lurk quietly in the darkness, yet have no way to avoid leaving any footprints.
Looking up, the deep and vast sky is nurturing countless stars. They flicker, they expand—one should say they're more like conveying some rhythm of heartbeat. They are star-eggs representing possibilities (after all, from an alien perspective, our solar system is merely such an indifferently shining point of light), so you begin to appreciate, and you begin to revere.
In such moments, one can simultaneously possess three forms of blessing: the sacred in despair, the tranquil in the sacred, and the desperate in tranquility.

### (III) San Juan
Rounding the fortified El Morro Castle, ships enter a narrow inland waterway. Docking at the port on the far western edge of the small city, centuries ago people would pour into the city through the only gap in the stone wall—the Gate of San Juan (nowadays, travelers arriving by sea all take enormous cruise ships docking at the newer port further east).
Climbing the steps onto the turquoise cobblestone road (these beautiful cobblestones are actually slag from iron smelting, transported here from Spain as ballast), at the road's end stands the Cathedral of San Juan. Serving simultaneously as San Juan's earliest building and the oldest Catholic church on U.S. territory, its furnishings could be described as quite restrained, or rather, well-ventilated.
At a glance, peeling lime has left the white walls somewhat mottled, and those ornaments decorating the sanctuary all carry a sticky, faded visual sensation from being dampened and baked by the hot climate—so much so that, just as people experience in winding canyons the sense of time when primitive oceans wash through the texture of stone, within these empty, clean church walls, time has taken away certain solemnity, certain human warmth, certain elaborate decorations, certain things that should make people feel both at peace and reverently fearful upon entering; what finally settles is only this ceremonial-less scaffold that becomes a desolate relic by providing people with physical shade.
But God once showed you favor! The bronze statue beside the Gate of San Juan depicts a bishop and three maidens holding high torches and crosses—it was these torches and hymns burning for prayer that made the invading English forces mistakenly believe Spanish reinforcements had arrived early... The city was saved! From one group of colonizers! By earlier-arriving colonizers!
Hope is always elusive. But even so, people never refuse hope.
It's just that before we called hope a miracle; now, we call it civilization.

Looking out through the gaps of the San Cristóbal Castle watchtower, the distant steaming tropical clouds are like fleets projected in a mirage. Years ago, real fleets sailed toward this completely unshielded land. Those fanatical Catholics, believing in legends devoid of religious color, hastily named all the land here El Dorado indiscriminately.
They brought governors, germs, cannons, and other devils—they brought civilization! Thus, colonization began.
Passing through the town's narrow streets, houses are painted in pastels, the low-saturated tones complementing the intense sunlight with a kind of innocent charm permeating within. From dusk onward, taverns are already packed, people greeting each other, dancing and embracing amid band performances and alcohol—they really resemble those tropical shrubs blown down by hurricanes all over the mountains, dying in great patches, living in great patches, thriving in great patches with such abundance they seem to learn no lessons.
Don't you really realize that you are actually victims?

### (IV) La Perla
Just one street away from the old city lies the La Perla (=Pearl) slum. Walking along the coastal road, these colorfully garish shanties are sandwiched between El Morro and San Cristóbal castles, like a fungus that maintains harsh growth by feeding on salty waves and vicious sunlight, rebellious to the point of having almost a touch of romance. At the town's periphery, an empty lot has been painted into a beautiful basketball court, featuring Carmelo Anthony's logo—this Puerto Rican born in Brooklyn feels responsible for his homeland after all. Rather than being generally summarized as promoting economic growth or maintaining community prosperity, this responsibility is more directly about letting nearby people have a ball to play with; besides this, appearing so alone in this place, it really serves no other purpose. Even more telling, during the three times I passed this route, this bright court remained persistently in a state of "waiting to be used."
This slum's moment of glory appeared in the 2017 brainwashing pop song "Despacito" music video, so that summer, tourists from around the world flooded into this drug-infested, impoverished place, leaving the struggling residents dumbfounded. But this wasn't entirely unexpected—after all, in that viral music video, a sexy woman dances in this fallen paradise, so this demon-infested dangerous place suddenly satisfied people's stereotypes about Latin America: passionate, unrestrained, wild growth... and beautiful, voluptuous women (Puerto Rico has already produced five Miss Universe winners!). Thus, during that peak period of endless crowds, the community committee decided to improve tourism facilities and raised $80,000 to repaint 402 residences... But now two years have passed, and aside from flaunting more vivid artificial colors, the tourism industry seems unchanged.
This inevitably brings to mind certain abrupt, sporadically standing high-rise buildings resembling cheap apartments encountered on the drive from the airport to San Juan. They display a kind of completed modernization on this decaying land; they represent the most irrelevant parts of some long-abandoned, impractical blueprint. And every day upon waking, the old streets would have a few more graffiti tags, along with rough white paint covering to erase these graffiti. The absurdity of this lies in the fact that even though Puerto Rico as a whole has functionally collapsed due to debt problems, in these most irrelevant places, municipal functions still seem to maintain basic operation.

### (V) After the Prosperity
Being born in a rapidly reviving country during a rapidly developing peaceful era, I never understood that there actually exists in the world something called decline—the opposite of growth. The first time I vividly felt this phenomenon truly exists was in a bus passing through a gloomy neighborhood in Pittsburgh (at the time I was heading to the downtown DMV to apply for a driver's license). However, the aimlessly wandering crowds downtown could only strengthen this impression.
If Pittsburgh showed me how a once-invincible steel center achieved a relatively dignified urban contraction in a manner worthy of sighs, then Puerto Rico gave me a feeling more like post-war devastation.
You could say they were abandoned, but while being abandoned, they desperately inject themselves with some dim hope, desperately watching for something. The Uber driver taking me into the old city pointed to San Cristóbal Castle and told me in broken English that the observation deck there allows one's vision to reach all the way to Bermuda... I think Márquez was right—Latin America's magical realism is rooted in its bloodstream: perhaps from the moment the pope walked through the city holding a torch, fate was already decided—they are all destined to wait, to watch, to expect rescue from the civilized world—just as the pope led the city's residents to wait for divine grace, La Perla waits for the next viral Latin song, and Puerto Rico waits for federal economic assistance amid a 45% poverty rate... You are destined only to wait for miracles.

### (VI) To be continued...
After traveling through Puerto Rico, I began contemplating this question: what does capitalism ultimately mean for civilizations outside the core circle?
A completely subjective, symbolically meaningful intuition tells me that capitalism is a ripening agent. These peripheral economies once gloriously ripened, and now it's time for them to rot.
Latin America in the '80s, Japan and Southeast Asia in the '90s, and perhaps Europe that's coming. So who will be the next to be bled dry?
Is it us?

### （一）库莱布拉和别克斯 (Culebra and Vieques）

车辆在狭长的海岸线上一遍遍来回犁地。会车并非不频繁，但道路始终保持着差一点就到双向车道的宽度——正如这缓慢变换的云隙间偶尔倾盆而下的阳光，带给人持续性的微小不适和间歇性的剧烈折磨。

一看便知磨损多年的载客用旅行车拉着我们颠簸向住处。冷气风力十足，性能却不见强劲，类似精力丰富却毫无话术可言的蹩脚销售员。司机只收了运输费，却也主动承担起向导的职责，于是我得以知道沿途驶过了也许具有纪念意义的，岛上唯一的天主教堂、唯一的市政府、唯一的钢筋架构的桥梁……车辆偶尔减速，为的是避让道路中央无所事事的黄狗，猫咪，公鸡，或者野马。

隔着一片玻璃看，无论如何都可以说是一个精简而怡人的村镇，甚至是富足的——波光粼粼的内海湾中停泊或漂浮着为数不少的帆船和游艇。

但唯有因移动而不断改换视野，令人不安的信号才间歇性地传来。比如路旁杂草丛中被弃置的轿车，歪斜而不可分辨的广告招牌，玻璃窗破损的无人独幢楼宇，以及与热门度假目的地极不相称的门户紧闭的商店街——况且还是感恩节。

阳光下，融化一切的热度中，万物静默，唯有藤蔓散发出几乎看得见水汽的生长信号。它们匍匐在地上，簇拥在海边，倒悬在枝杈间，它们以一种进化得完全适应气候的姿态活得满山遍野。它们什么都能够吞噬，正如瘟疫什么都可以传染。

黄昏，夕阳宿命般沉沦。浓厚的乌云如逐渐开启的帘幕般消失，那个完全暴露于海平面上的球体突然重新鼓起力气，于是整个天穹都因之残留下久久不散的辉煌叹息。但最终胜利的还是蓝色。蓝色是倔强的，哪怕正午时分它们被穿透烧灼而无限接近于透明……最终，猎户的腰带亮了。

入夜时分，临海路的街灯发出不详的红光（没错，是纯红色的灯光）。这是一个适宜暗物逡巡出没的节点（这倾颓而煞白的墙壁后面窥伺着什么呢？），而唯有以吉普车的钢筋铁骨般绝对的机械性，才能在此抗拒住整个夜晚都必然遭遇的侵蚀。蜷缩于这庇护中沿路行驶，还好有稀疏的酒馆弥散出白炽灯毫无温感的光亮。你知道这种光亮里面可以流淌出人造的杂音，于是你把这种暂时的安心称之为家。

你看，这个小镇算是死掉了，或至少也是病得不轻。

### （二）荧光海滩

船底透明的皮划艇逐渐点燃顺着水流的细密光点，仿佛广袤的黑暗中，有一支执著的箭矢在摩擦生火。

离岸更远的地方，整个水域都变成具有魔法的触媒，搅动海面，波纹在瞬时被具象化，宛如一曲可以被看见的回音。

船桨规律滑动，光因之摇曳而时显时隐，我尽可能悄悄潜伏在黑暗中，却没有办法不留下任何足印。

抬头向上望，深邃而辽夐的天空正孕育出无数的星星。它们在闪烁，在膨胀，应该说更像是传达出某种心音的律动——它们是一个个代表可能性的星之卵（毕竟丛外星看来，太阳系也仅仅就是这样一个无差别闪亮的光点罢了），于是你开始欣赏，也开始敬畏。

在这种时刻，人可以同时拥有三种形式的祝福：绝望的神圣，神圣的宁静，和宁静的绝望。

### （三）圣胡安（San Juan）

绕过要塞化的莫罗古堡，船只进入一片狭窄的内海水域。停靠小城的极西边的港口，几世纪前的人们便从石墙上唯一的缺口——圣璜之门——涌入城内（如今海路至此的旅客，却都是乘坐巨大的游轮停靠更东边的新港）。

拾级踏上翠蓝色的卵石路（这漂亮的卵石却是用炼铁产生的矿渣，它们被当做压舱物从西班牙被运至此地），道路尽头矗立着圣约翰大教堂。同时作为圣胡安最早期的建筑以及美国境内最古老的天主教堂，它的陈设可以说显得非常克制，或者说，具有良好的通风效果。

粗略看去，脱落的石灰已让白墙有些斑驳，而那些装点圣堂的饰品，无不带有一种因为受潮和被炎热气候烘焙而带来的黏答答的褪色的视觉感，以至于——正如人们在曲折的峡谷中体会到的原始海洋从那石头的纹理中冲刷而过的时间感——在这空旷白净的教堂的四壁之内，时间带走了某些威严，某些烟火，某些精雕细琢的装饰，某些本应该让人一踏进门就感到心安并同时诚惶诚恐的东西；于是最终沉淀下来的只有这毫无仪式感的棚架，通过给人们提供物理性的阴凉而成为荒芜的遗迹。

可是天主曾经有恩于你们啊！圣璜之门旁文物似的青铜雕像刻着高擎火炬和十字架的主教和三位少女——就是这些为祈祷而燃烧的火把和圣歌，让入侵的英军误认为西班牙的援军已提前到达……城市被拯救了！从一群殖民者手中！被更早到来的殖民者！

希望永远是缥缈的。但即使这样，人们永远不会拒绝希望。

只是以前我们把希望叫做神迹，现在，我们把它称做文明。

从圣克里斯多巴城堡瞭望塔的缝隙向外眺望，远处蒸腾的热带云犹如投射于蜃楼中的舰队。而多年以前，是真正的舰队向这片毫无遮拦的大地驶来，那些狂热的天主教徒听信毫无宗教色彩的传说，就着急地把这里的土地无差别地命名为黄金国。

他们带来了总督、病菌、枪炮和其他魔鬼——他们带来了文明！于是，拓荒和殖民就这样开始了。

从小镇狭窄的街道穿过，房屋被漆得粉粉彩彩，低饱和的色调和强烈的阳光相得益彰，自有一种天真烂漫的氛围氤氲在里面。黄昏时分开始，酒馆就已经拥堵不堪，人们在乐队的演奏和酒精中相互问好、舞蹈和拥抱——他们真的很像那些飓风天中被吹倒的漫山遍野的热带灌木，一大片片地死，一大片片地生，一大片片的简直繁茂得不长教训。

你们真的没有意识到自己其实是受害者吗？

### （四）La Perla

与老城仅仅一街之隔的地方，是La Perla（=珍珠）贫民窟。沿着临海路散步经过，这些缤纷到格格不入的的平房被夹在莫罗古堡和圣克里斯多巴城堡之间，像一块靠吸食咸湿的海浪和毒辣的阳光而维持严酷生长的真菌，叛逆到几乎有了一丝浪漫的味道。镇子边陲有一块空地被漆成漂亮的篮球场，上面印有卡梅隆·安东尼的甜瓜标志，这名出生在布鲁克林的波多黎各人毕竟对故乡感到肩有责任——而这种责任与其被笼统概括为促进经济增长或维持社区兴繁，不如说就是直来直往的让附近的人有球可打；毕竟除此以外，它如此孤零零地现身此地，也委实没有其他作用了。甚至是说，在我经过这段路途的三段时间之内，这片鲜艳的场地始终只是持续性地处于“等待被使用”的状态。

这个贫民窟的高光时刻出现在2017年的洗脑流行歌曲Despacito（=慢慢来）的MV中，于是在那个夏天，世界各地的游客涌进这个毒品滋生的潦倒之处，让挣扎于此的居民大跌眼镜。但这也并非那么意外，毕竟在那红透南北的音乐短片中，一个性感的女郎就在这片失乐园中踢踏舞蹈，于是这百鬼横行的凶险之地突然就满足了人们对于拉丁美洲的刻板印象：热情、奔放、野蛮生长……还有美丽丰满的女人（从波多黎各已经走出了多达5位的环球小姐！）。于是，在那人流络绎不绝的鼎盛时期，这里的社区委员就决定完善其旅游设施，还集资8万美元把402间住宅重新粉刷……可如今两年时间过去，除了招摇着更加鲜艳的人造色之外，好像其旅游业也并没有什么改观。

这不得不让人联想起在从机场驶向圣胡安途中经过的某些突兀的，如廉价公寓搬挺立的零星高层建筑。它们在这片衰颓的土地上显出一种现代化的进行完结式，它们代表了某个早被抛弃的不切实际的蓝图中最无关紧要的部分。以及，每一天醒来，古街就会多几道涂鸦，以及为了抹消这些涂鸦而粗糙遮盖的白色油漆。这种事情的荒唐在就在于，哪怕整体来看波多黎各已经因为债务问题功能性地瘫痪了，在这种最无关紧要的地方，市政功能又仿佛还能维持基本的运转。

### （五）繁华过后

是出生于一个快速复兴的国家和快速发展的和平年代，让我一直没能明白世界上居然也存在衰退——增长的反面，这种东西。而我第一次鲜明感受到这种现象确实存在，是在匹兹堡的公车中掠过的一片阴森的街区（彼时我正准备到市中心的车管所申请驾照）。然而，市中心无所事事般往来的人群只能更加加强这种印象。

如果说匹兹堡让我看到了曾经不可一世的钢铁中心以一种值得唏嘘的姿态实现还算体面的城市收缩，那么波多黎各带给我的感受则仿佛是某种战乱后的疮痍。

你可以说，他们被抛弃了，但被抛弃的同时，它们又在竭力向自己注入某种渺茫的希冀，竭力在守望着什么。载我进老城的Uber司机指着圣克里斯多巴城堡，用并不流利的英文告诉我说，那里的眺望台可以让视野一直驰骋到百慕大……我想马尔克斯说的不错，拉丁美洲的魔幻是根植在其血脉中的：也许从教皇举着火炬在城里穿过的时候，命运就已经决定了——你们，你们，还有他们，都注定要等待、要守望、要期待文明世界的援救——像教皇带领城内的居民等待天恩一般，La Perla在等待下一首爆红的拉丁歌曲，而波多黎各在45%的贫困率中等待联邦政府的经济资助……你们注定只是等待奇迹。

### （六）つづく

游历波多黎各之后，我开始思考这样一个问题：资本主义对于非核心圈的文明究竟意味着什么。
一种完全出于主观感受的具有象征意味的直觉告诉我，资本主义是一味催熟剂。这些边缘经济体也曾辉煌地熟透过，而现在是到了腐烂的时候了。
80年代的拉美，90年代的日本和东南亚，以及或行将到来的欧洲。那么（再）下一个被吸血的是谁呢？
是我们吗？
